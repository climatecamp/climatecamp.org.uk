  <h1>Monday 23rd August: Action round-up</h1>
  
  <p>The Climate Camp media team have issued a press release providing an overview of the main actions that have taken place today.</p>
<p><a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/press/2010/08/23/rbs-operations-closed-for-the-day-as-activists-target-sites-around-edinburgh">You can read it here</a></p>
<p>Importantly, the media team have expressed bewilderment as to police claims of oil being spilled on a main road, and have no knowledge who was responsible for it if the incident did take place.</p>

	  <p>A successful day???<br />
Do you even know how much damage you idiots caused??? And guess where the money comes from to fix that damage and clean up all the crap you morons did&#8230; TAXPAYERS</p>
<p>As a taxpayer I want to beat the crap out of you, and as a human being I want to beat the crap out of you again.</p>
<p>Biggest load of morons on the planet!!</p>

	  <p>As demo&#8217;s go I think this attempt was weak, lacked good ideas, leadership and PR. I think you guys need to re think what, where and when as this one did not fly on any count. </p>
<p>If done properly you&#8217;d have gained more support, understanding and awareness but instead you&#8217;ve antagonised those people directly impacted by your actions and irritated your sympathisers by the bad PR.</p>

	  <p>As for your media team being bewildered&#8230; What do you expect when you encourage people to take action as far as they are willing to. Your encouragement of these actions make you as guilty as those that did it. I&#8217;m just glad no one got hurt, otherwise you would have blood on your hands.</p>

	  <p>Why all the self-congratulation at &#8220;closing down&#8221; the RBS headquarters for a day?  Like any big organisation, RBS has systems in place for key people to work at home, so nothing grinds to a halt.  As for staff who are not required to work at home, no doubt they would be more than happy to have an extra day &#8211; on full pay &#8211; added to their weekend.  And, since you are so concerned about the taxpayers funding RBS, who would be paying for staff to have an extra day off on full pay?  The taxpayer, of course!!</p>

	  <p>What you people did today really showed you in your real light, you care little about the cause you claim to hold so dear, shame on you for pouring oil on a busy main road placing the lifes of every man woman and child using that road in real danger. Criminals who&#8217;s true remit is to have a go at the police and cause as much damage as possible before going back to your homes and leaving the people of Edinburgh to pick up the bill. Go home you are NOT wanted here.</p>

	  <p>Such a bunch of irresponsible idiots. Damaging property is of no benefit to your cause, legitimate though it may be.</p>
<p>Did you all walk to the camp or did any of you use transport, thereby contributing to global warming!  Think about that</p>
<p>If any of yor mates wre responsible for the oil on the roads you should be ashamed, but I don&#8217;t think you have the brains.</p>

	  <p>I have this wonderful dream.</p>
<p>It is a dream where all those people who support alternative energy, wind, solar, wave, whatever, take themselves off to live in land where &#8216;green&#8217; energy is their only source of power.</p>
<p>It would be idyllic, a place of shuffling sandal clad mung bean munching tree hugging dreamers, gathered around a camp fire singing folksy songs.</p>
<p>Not for them the trappings of modernity supplied by oil, gas, coal or nuclear power. As pious advocates of an alternative lifestyle, pride would not allow them to take advantage of anything like that.</p>
<p>Then in my dream the leader of this band of idealists requires surgery. The surgeon, knife in hand, gazes out of the hospital tent towards a distant wind farm. The blades are still. No wind. No light. No heat, no nothing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately at that point I wake up.</p>

	  <p>Was that it &#8211; A day of action which involved </p>
<p>Throwing some treacle at some buildings<br />
Climbing onto the roof or putting a few banners up<br />
Using some superglue<br />
Causing a bit of congestion in and around the Gyle<br />
Trying to stop a speaker at the Festival who is actually against the banks (that was clever &#8211; why no mnetion in the press release?)</p>
<p>Whoopee – you must be very proud and for what </p>
<p>The people of Edinburgh will already have forgotten about you by tomorrow as they go about their daily business</p>
<p>Cairn Energy are still drilling, Forth Energy are still building power stations and RBS …..Hate to tell you but no matter how much spin you put on it RBS operations did not grind to a halt, its 1200 branches still operated, the cash machines kept going, its daily processing was completed and no doubt the corporate guys did some more deals with oil companies. Sure the staff got a day out of the office but I quite enjoyed missing the usual commute, relaxing at home doing my work and no soakings to boot in that rain. </p>
<p>As someone said on your facebook page, more like a badly organised Rag day outing by students. It would be funny but for the darker side with someone trying to cause traffic chaos and threatening the lives of motorists by covering roads with oil. Which mindless thug will hold their hands up to that in the name of climate change?? Your media department don’t have the guts to answer questions on this or the fact RBS (dissappointingly) have allowed them pretty much to do everything on site with their blessing. Such a radical movement … not. </p>
<p>Good bye – just make sure Gogarburn grounds are returned to how you found them.</p>

	  <p>Climate Camp = cowards bent on mindless vandalism and violence.  Not one of the cowards from this organisation dare answer a question because they know they are in the wrong.  As for those arrested, I hope they get a very long jail sentence in order to reflect on their violent ways.  Climate Camp members are nothing but the scum of the earth &#8211; total brain dead wasters who should be ashamed of themselves.  On a Monday, most hard working folk are at work &#8211; what were climate camp folk doing?  Nothing but wasting tax payers money.  It is quite clear they are long haired, benefit scroungers who are shy of a bar of soap.  I hope the riot police finish you off.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;RBS Operations Closed for the Day as Activists Target Sites around Edinburgh&#8221; </p>
<p>Clearly you&#8217;ve not heard of Business Continuity Planning!! Operations continued, just in different locations&#8230;good planning on behalf of RBS &#8211; but then they always have been a few steps ahead of you!</p>
<p>So whatever you were trying to achieve you failed. All you&#8217;ve done is waste valuable resources&#8230;.or did you think all the damage you&#8217;ve caused would repair itself naturally &#8211; it won&#8217;t&#8230; </p>
<p>Do you think it is OK for environmental campaigners to waste resources and damage the environment through vandalism? Because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been doing for the last few days. How does that make you any better than those you oppose? </p>
<p>We won&#8217;t expect an answer &#8216;Simon&#8217;, so don&#8217;t worry. I think everyone opposed to your actions, who has contributed on here, has given up on anyone from climate camp answering direct questions about their actions.  However, if you do answer, you&#8217;ll no doubt try to persuade us that it&#8217;s OK because it&#8217;s smaller scale, or because a small crime is OK etc etc &#8211; well it&#8217;s not!</p>

	  <p>Too easy for the police to set this oil situation up.  I do not believe for a second it was committed by Climate Camp.  Those who understand the media propaganda machine that is the spectacle can see through this stunt.  Watch the media spin this story with no evidence!</p>

	  <p>&#8220;We did it!<br />
We closed RBS HQ for the day as autonomous actions hit climate criminals across the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t really though did you? If you&#8217;d &#8216;done it&#8217;, RBS wouldn&#8217;t have been able to operate&#8230;.instead they carried on operating following their carefully planned procedures etc. And so, you were prevented from taking much in the way of further &#8216;direct action&#8217; at Gogarburn mainly because by most people working from home or other sites, you had no audience and noone to intimidate&#8230;so you had to &#8216;walk&#8217; to other locations (presumably you didn&#8217;t use any form of transport that requires oil!).</p>
<p>Your headline needs an amendment &#8216;RBS did it&#8217; &#8211; they definitely got one over on you! Much harder to intimidate in small groups than a large gang of 500+ isn&#8217;t it?!</p>

	  <p>Your headline says you closed RBS for the day. Erm, news for you &#8211; no you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It then says you hit climate criminals. Erm, news for you once again &#8211; the criminals today were you.</p>
<p>You must, by now, be taken aback by the anger and outrage directed at you across the media by the public. It is the public, after all, that you need to support you. All that you have done is lost all credit, all respect and you will be leaving Edinburgh in utter disgrace.</p>
<p>I would hope that not one of you would have the gall to return again. You are not welcome, you are not wanted (except by the authorities) and you are parasites.</p>

	  <p>Would it not have been more sensible to try to encourage RBS employees to see things from your perspective so that they could campaign internally for dealings with environmentally suspect companies to be curtailed? Instead, you took a ridiculously childish approach that hasn&#8217;t done anything to further your cause. As previous comments have stated, you didn&#8217;t have any impact on RBS&#8217;s operations (that&#8217;s what happens when you target the admin functions rather than the guys in London actually lending the money to the oil industry, geniuses) and actually caused a far greater CO2 output by forcing staff to travel to the contingency site in the middle of nowhere &#8211; no public transport for getting there &#8211; and for the police to mobilize in such great numbers.</p>
<p>So, despite all of the self-congratulatory waffle on your Twitter feed, you failed. On an epic scale.</p>

	  <p>Would just like to tell the twat who made the below comment to wake up and smell the coffee.  Corporations control our world and our politicans and our media.  If we do not act now our world will very shortly become completely uninhabitable.  Stop watching and start living.  We must all get active and not simply watch the most powerful and greedy destroy our world!</p>
<p>Make an effort to search for the truth yourself and do not repeat what you here off the tv parrot fashion.  Wake up!!!!!</p>

<p>Did the below poster not see that these people are everyday people.  They just happen to give a shit about our world and see how our politicians are in the pockets of the corporate world that are now the most powerful force on earth that only care for profit.  Posts such as this scream out ill informed individuals that get there info from the murdoch press like the Sun/Fox/Times.  That do not bother to research a subject themsleves and just believe all they hear from offical channels.  You are very sad or indeed paid to be posting by those that wish this grass roots movement with great potential to fail.  Well done Climate Camp the powers that be have clearly took notice of you, and you should be proud of your efforts.  The below poster needs to wake up!</p>
<p>Climate Camp = cowards bent on mindless vandalism and violence. Not one of the cowards from this organisation dare answer a question because they know they are in the wrong. As for those arrested, I hope they get a very long jail sentence in order to reflect on their violent ways. Climate Camp members are nothing but the scum of the earth – total brain dead wasters who should be ashamed of themselves. On a Monday, most hard working folk are at work – what were climate camp folk doing? Nothing but wasting tax payers money. It is quite clear they are long haired, benefit scroungers who are shy of a bar of soap. I hope the riot police finish you off.</p>

	  <p>I have not seen the evidence that was the case.  If it happened, yes bloody stupid thing.  I would not put it past it being a set up.  I don&#8217;t believe all I read and hear that comes from official sources.  I am too long in the tooth for that.  I remember Hillsborough as an example and the lies written about liverpool football fans that came from Police sources.  Our world is being vandalised by the corporate world that is for certain.  Profit is all they seek at the expense, of all of us.  </p>
<p>It is this profit at any cost attitude that must change and our natural environment must be considered.  Sustainability is the key a balance between giving and taking.  </p>
<p>Too many people passively absorb so much junk on TV and don&#8217;t even read these days.  It is frightening how brainwashed the masses have become.  A grass roots movement that gets out and demonstrates and get&#8217;s the peoples voice heard is what is needed above the spectacle of the media owned by the vested interests of the most powerful that have the most to lose from slowing down on their consumption.</p>
<p>Some spirit is what is needed to stand up to a corporate world that enslaves the third world in sweatshop labour in order to maximise profits.  Factory farm animals so that they do not even see the light of day.  It is this profit at all cost attitude that is ruining our world.</p>
<p>Economics really isn&#8217;t cool, numbers are shallow, science and technology has become as much of a dogma as Religion!!!!</p>

	  <p>Again, agreed. But there is a big difference between a peaceful march for instance and people smashing up buildings and pouring oil on motorways. That is why I&#8217;m opposed.  As for not reading, I have read a lot on this site about your beliefs, your cause. However, you fail to see we are in a period of transition, this won&#8217;t happen overnight.  Your actions are not speeding it up, if anything it is putting true environmentalists in the same stead as climate camp, which is a shame.</p>

<p>Climate camp are protecting about a profit at all costs attititude that is destroying our environment.  Such as drilling in the arctic.  BP is a British company doughnut and look what unsafe drilling has done to cost of the US.  I think for a tiny island history tells us we&#8217;ve actually reaped quite a bit of destruction.  Nothing has changed same callous attitude rules the world, perhaps it&#8217;s time for a change.  Ignorance like the below comment is frightening.  </p>

	  <p>It was pointless, pathetic, arsey, and totally irrelevant.  You got fuck all news coverage and everyone thinks you are a bunch of wankers.  RBS don&#8217;t give a fuck and neither does anyone else.  You couldn&#8217;t even get more than two &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; to come and support you.  If they were that bothered or thought you were anything other than a bunch of pointless twats I&#8217;m sure they would have come in their droves.  The bottom line is the reason you have to resort to pointless tactics like today is because you are irrelevant and nobody gives a shit what you have to say or ever listens.  The reason is 99% of you have no credibility and are a rag tag bunch of alchys, posh students and psychologically fucked people looking for something to make their unbearably empty lives seem worth living.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the tar sands.  They did four days ago.  Nothing you have done since then has made any further difference except piss people off.  I was actually on the verge of writing to RBS whom I bank with and have my mortgage with about it but you can fuck off.  I hope they dig the whole fucking lot up and drown you idiots in diesel fumes. Piss off back to your bedsits and booze you&#8217;re just junkies but more irritating and pointless and without the smack.</p>

You&#8217;re actually right about all your ridiculous theories and anyone who disagrees with you is a secret government agent just trying to make you look bad and discredit your ideas to prevent people discovering the one real truth &#8211; yours.  You total muppet.  Wake up and smell the coffee.  The government, like RBS and everyone else in Edinburgh doesn&#8217;t give a shit about these pointless idiots.</p>

	  <p>To your protest was shit!</p>
<p>I think the fact that your on this site relentlessly posting is proof positive that actually people have taken notice of this movement.  Their is a growing anti-corporate movement growing all around the world.  It does not mean you are a leftie if you wish to save our natural world.  </p>
<p>The profit at all cost mentality has raped our planets resources for far too long.  Sustainability ie the balance between giving and taking simply has to be observed if we are going to save our world.</p>
<p>The corporate philosophy if not stopped, that cares only for profit at any cost to the environment, people and animals will make our planet completely inhabitable otherwise!</p>

	  <p>Mr Smith</p>
<p>This idiotic excursion has made not a jot of differece to my notice of environment issues.  I studied and environmental degree at uni when global warming and peak oil were only starting to gain academic ineterest and no one else had heard of it.</p>
<p>I do not subscribe to profit at any cost.</p>
<p>I do subscribe to sustainability.</p>
<p>I loathe ignorant, self righteous, provocateurs and tag alongs who just want to fuck things up rather than do anything about it.</p>
<p>I support education, more education and that followed by achievemnt and responsibilty by enabling positiv change.</p>
<p>I do not support the thick, dysfunctional and irrelevant behaving like twats.</p>
<p>Additionally I have extensive practical experience of the realities of the environment which these almost exclusively city people cannot even fathom.  Don&#8217;t talk to me about tar sands when you&#8217;ve never started a generator or pulled a lamb out of a sheeps nether regions.  Climbing up a pole and throwing pretend tar at a building doesn;t change the world, it just makes you an embarassing wanker.</p>
<p>These idiots are doing more to retard the progress of real change than any big oil sponsored agitator could dream of.  They don;t even need to try.  These fuckwits need to grow up, get an education and stard behaving like responsible members of society instead of spoilt brats and hobos on a power trip.</p>

	  <p>Another &#8216;environmental&#8217; protest farce that achieved precisely the opposite effect it was meant to. </p>
<p>Why?  The methodology is all wrong.  On two levels.  Firstly, much as you people go on about police or pick-an-agency bullying, it&#8217;s you that are trying to push and ram-fuck an agenda.  Edinburgh is a fabulous, fine, city.  Do you really think super-glueing yourself to anything and clogging up aerterial routes to the capital accomplishes anything?  Other than pissing working people off.  You people are the real bullies.  And shame on you for it.  The worst thing is you don&#8217;t even realise it. </p>
<p>Why?  Part two.  Here&#8217;s a thing.  Most of us have more immediate worries to consider.  Perhaps you don&#8217;t.  I kinda wish I had that luxury.</p>

	  <p>Was sympathetic to the cause, and you know what? I kinda like the environment, cos I live there. But you guys got it all wrong, you&#8217;re an absolute disgrace and have done the planet no favours by turning off so many good people &#8211; you&#8217;ve completely and utterly failed in your objectives as far as i can tell. The sad thing is, you&#8217;ll never know it.</p>
<p>And oil on the road??? Don&#8217;t you dare try to wriggle out of that one. I drive on that road with my wife and 10 week old son, and it&#8217;s by the grace of God you didn&#8217;t kill them. Your representatives are YOUR responsibility, ALL of them. Take some responsibility for once and stop blaming everybody else for all the worlds problems. Try to regain a shred of respectability here (haha) ***** by apologising unreservadly on your website ***** &#8211; you could have KILLED people! What is wrong with you.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t hold my breath waiting though. No doubt it was a banker fatcat / police conspiracy. Bunch of losers, you had an opportunity and you blew it.</p>
<p>People&#8217;s hatred of you is apparent in the comments here, and bear in mind most people just can&#8217;t be bothered posting or even visiting the site because you are irrelevant. Caring for the environment isn&#8217;t mate, but you lot are.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re nothing but a bunch of pointless gypo scumbag wank-heads. Fucking useless would-be murderers. Get out of my city and never come back. Filthy fuckers.</p>

	  <p>As a committed environmentalist living in Scotland, I would like to say well done to the Climate Camp protestors for their actions this week.</p>
<p>Well done for creating genuine public sympathy for the RBS, which is something I never thought I would see in a million years in Scotland.</p>
<p>Well done for tarring all genuine environmentalists with the same molasses brush as the mindless eco-criminals who tried to kill road users on the A8 and A720 all the way from RBS @ Gogarburn to RBS @ Drummond House, the Gyle, by pouring oil on the wet roads.</p>
<p>Well done for turning everyone in Scotland (including its environmental activists) against you.</p>
<p>And well done for making the police look good – an accomplishment that no previous Climate Camp has managed before.  It seems your tactics for goading them into violence failed to their credit and your eternal shame.</p>
<p>Go and live in a real police state and see how tolerant they are to protestors who commit crime.</p>
<p>Gandhi? You have no right to use his name.  He was against violence.</p>

Not only that, have you any idea of how many people sat in traffic jams around Edinburgh polluting the environment and using up gallons of our precious fossil fuels.

	  <p>All the moaning posts are great. They prove that the camp is having an effect and is getting the issues across. Beyond the moaners the silent majority lie and not all of them will agree with the moaners.</p>
<p>I got to the camp by walking and using the bus. The bus would have been operated whether I was on it or not, so the extra greenhouse gases by it carrying me were minimal.</p>
<p>We is the appropriate word to use about RBS. Most climate campers work and all of them pay taxes, it is only rich people like senior bankers who avoid paying some taxes by clever financial tricks.</p>

	  <p>Hello Again John. You truly are deluded. I have never in my life posted on any blog before this week, but your mob&#8217;s criminal and pointless actions have forced me to vent. If you think that the silent majority are behind you, why don&#8217;t you set up in the High Street today, introduce yourself and find out what kind of reception you would get. Please film it too, we could all do with a laugh.<br />
PS &#8211; I am more concerned about the antics of your mob than I ever will be about Tar Sands. Another convert eh? Nice.</p>

	  <p>John you need to get your head out of your arse.. yes you got people to listen, but not about your issues, but rather how disgusted we have been with the way CC have conducted themselves.  Im only posting here because i am so disgusted by the fact that CC are incapable of organising a simple peaceful protest which has cost the taxpayers over £100,000, and could have cost some innocent civilians lives. </p>
<p>So live in denial, but if you wanted to see the true reaction you would get from the public, listen to the post above.</p>

I hope you have cleaned up and left the grounds and the raods around RBS the same way as you found them..<br />
The great things is all the hatred on here and all the newspapers against you guys..<br />
Wake up start living in the real world.. and by the way you better start a whip around before you leave Gogarburn for 100k for the police bill etc.<br />

	  <p>The costs for policing should be billed to Climate Change.  Those attending this camp were nothing but thugs, intent on violence and vandalism.  Climate Change does nothing but encourage such unlawful acts and should be banned.  I am very pleased to see on tonights television, that all the scum leaving the camp site are being searched, their details noted, and most importantly, their photographs are being took.  Climate Change you are not welcome in Scotland &#8211; go and take your dirty tricks back home.  Go and smash your own windows and spread oil over your own roads.  As an Edinburgh Council Tax payer, it is me that pays for your &#8220;happy holiday&#8221; &#8211; how are you going to repay me?  Or will you shrug your shoulders and pass all responsibility onto others who have nothing to do with you?</p>
<p>CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOTHING BUT UTTER SCUM &#8211; DON&#8217;T EVER COME BACK TO SCOTLAND &#8211; GO BACK TO YOUR PARENTS IN ENGLAND AND CREATE THE SAME MESS IN THEIR HOUSES &#8211; AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.</p>
<p>CLIMATE CHANGE &#8211; YOUR MEMBERS ARE UTTER LAYABOUT MAGGOTS.  I HOPE THE DHSS WERE WATCHING YOUR LAZY WORKSHY MEMBERS IN EDINBURGH AND STOP THEIR DOLE MONEY.</p>

	  <p>The media team are &#8216;bewildered&#8217; at the claims of oil on the a8. Presumably not bewildered at video footage of windows being smashed. Anyway it has all been said. I have voted Green at every election I could since 1997. I am ashamed of association with you people. This will go on record as the biggest failure of our movement in the last decade. You are juveniles and I will also be cancelling my membership of FOE until its leaders denouce you rather than be part of your media team being &#8216;bewildered&#8217;. Why pick on a bank anyway? Presumably my car loan from Lloyds means you will be attacking them for funding my fossil fuel burning rather than persuading me to scrap my car. Fools. And I am a Green voter!! Robin Harper do something please&#8230;..</p>

	  <p>Regardless of whether or not the camp was responsible for the road spillage (and I do not buy the lame conspiracy theories for a second) the actions of the protesters I saw with my own eyes were nothing more than juvenile vandalism.  Your cause is environmental yet you have damaged and defaced property meaning cleaning products will be used, and new glass will need to be made.  These have a negative environmental effect.  Vegetation and reed beds have been trampled and damaged by you at the HQ and emergency services and police have been taken up dealing with childish pranks.</p>
<p>I work for myself and your selfish, juvenile actions have stopped me working for two days and counting.  That&#8217;s two day&#8217;s wages I will lose.  I have two small children to support and this is something no one needs in these poor economic times.</p>
<p>My wife and I try to live with consideration for the environment and your actions have left me with nothing but contempt for you and your cause.</p>

	  <p>Where are the comments from those from Climate Change?  Obviously they have crawled back under the stone they came from.  Climate Change and it&#8217;s members are nothing but scum.  They are the sort of sh1t I wipe off my shoes.  Climate Change members are nothing but juvenile, childish maggots who should be put down.  I sincerely hope that those arrested are sent to jail for many, many years.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;the police have already confirmed a trail of thhhe oil went back to the campsite. They reported this on BBC Scotland News.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then even a police force as inefficient as Lothian and Borders would by now have followed the trail back to the campsite. The trolls tell us that all the protestors from England, so the police would have found someone who said</p>

<p>I was on a stall ten days ago, which is how I gauge what the silent majority think.</p>
<p>From the anonymity of their keyboards a handful of posters have been offered the chance to let off some steam. They have threatened many things which they wouldn&#8217;t do in real life.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time for John Prescott, but I think his remark about the contorted faces of the Countryside Alliance sums up my attitude to those who loudly condemn climate camp.</p>

	  <p>Take note of the followinng from the BBC news website.  The climate camp scum have appeared in court, and not one of them is from Scotland.  These maggots are not welcome in Scotland:</p>
<p>&#8220;Five climate change activists have come before Edinburgh Sheriff Court over the Royal Bank of Scotland protests.</p>
<p>Giovanna Speciale, 38 and Tim Gee, 25, both from London, along with Cara Whelan, from Caredigion, Wales, denied breaches of the peace.</p>
<p>Eleanor Smith, 24, from London, denied painting graffiti on RBS bins and Martin Wallace, 58, from France, denied assaulting a policeman.</p>
<p>The Gogurburn climate camp was set up in protest at RBS&#8217;s oil investments.</p>
<p>All five were granted bail on the special conditions that they left Edinburgh by 1900 BST on Monday and that they did not enter the city unless attending court or pre-arranged meetings with their solicitor.</p>
<p>They were also told not to go within 500 yards of the RBS HQ at Gogurburn.</p>
<p>Mr Speciale, Mr Gee and Ms Whelan are accused of committing a breach of the peace on 23 August at a branch of the RBS in Nicolson Street by preventing customers from entering and by chanting slogans and gluing themselves to each other and the entrance door of the premises.</p>
<p>Ms Smith was accused of painting graffiti on eight bins belonging to the bank on the Royal Mile on 23 August and damaging them.</p>
<p>Mr Wallace was accused of assaulting Sgt Kevin Storey of Lothian and Borders Police at Gogarburn Bridge on 22 August by rubbing his head, which had nettles attached, against the policeman&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>He was also accused of assaulting unknown officers by attempting to strike them with a stick or similar instrument.</p>
<p>A total of 18 people have been arrested since the Climate Camp was set up in Gogurburn last Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>CLIMATE CAMP &#8211; WHY NO COMMENTS ON THE SCUM IN COURT?</p>

	  <p>John, stop deluding yourself about the &#8220;silent majority&#8221; and come back to the real world. There&#8217;s a reason the majority are silent and that&#8217;s because either they think you&#8217;re just a total bunch of twats or couldn&#8217;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to defend the indefensible why don&#8217;t you get a job and pay some taxes to help foot the bill that you and your stinky friends have created?</p>
