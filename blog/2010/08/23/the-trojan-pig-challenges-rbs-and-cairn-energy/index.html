	  <p>Climate camp today targetted the RBS headquarters. Unfortunately, all staff where given the day off, so the protest wasn&#8217;t as effective as it was meant to be.<br />
On top of this, the &#8220;peaceful protest&#8221; turned into vandalism, not to mention a banner contained the F word was hung, so any children who read it can expand their vocabulary.<br />
Oil was spread over main roads, so all the people driving to work could have potentially skidding, caused a pile up and multiple deaths!! (and by poeple heading to work, I don&#8217;t mean RBS, because as I mentioned, they had the day off).</p>
<p>So well done climate camp, you are successfully making it harder for people to work, hurting people who have nothing to do with those you are protesting against and screwing up the envirnoment even more. I was all for saving the environment, but now I want to ruin it just to spite you all.</p>

	  <p>I don&#8217;t really see how you are claiming this camp as a success. Shame you can&#8217;t do opinion polls but as far as I and many others see it, you have come across as criminals hiding behind the excuse of being concerned about the climate.</p>
<p>I am so glad you are all leaving. Please don&#8217;t come back, no one wanted you here in the first  place, and your actions this past week has confirmed that.</p>
<p>So shame on you all</p>

	  <p>Oh for heaven&#8217;s sake all of you negative posters above! Leave your personally insulting demonstrations of your own inability to read the website you are commenting on (any &#8220;oil&#8221; spilled on roads was unknown to climatee camp, if it happened at all) to the Scotsman (or more likely, I expect, Evening Times) boards. Have you gone yet? Good.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, Climate Campers, and good luck next year!</p>

	  <p>Notice that all the cyber-bullies haven&#8217;t the courage to post under their own names. </p>
<p>Had any protestors put oil or similar on the road, that would have been bloody stupid. But the camp is denying any knowledge of such an incident. Until we know for sure what happened, let&#8217;s try to keep a clear head.</p>
<p>Unlike the anonymous posters, I went to see the camp for myself and was impressed by the kindness, dedication and idealism of the people I met there. We can disagree about the tactics employed by the camp, but it seems to me that the true outrage is not a few thrown golf-balls, but the destruction of a vast swathe of Alberta funded by RBS &#8211; or the greed and recklessness of RBS investments that are fueling climate change. The real story here &#8211; ignored by the media until these protestors turned up &#8211; is that RBS, since it was bailed out by the tax-payer, has sunk £13 billion into fossil fuel projects versus £83 million into renewables. And don&#8217;t take my word for it; see here and here:</p>

<p>As for &#8216;soap-dodging hippies&#8217;, these must include the likes of Iain Banks and the Church of Scotland:</p>

<p>Come on, angry keyboarders: you&#8217;re being played. Swallow your pride and consider who&#8217;s really screwing your future. Is it really a few hundred eco-protestors?</p>

	  <p>Of course they are claiming it had nothing to do with them, do you honestly think they are going to admit that? Of course not. </p>

	  <p>£117 Billion according to your video ? &#8230; eh &#8230; I don&#8217;t think so &#8230;  UK banks received around £40 Billion government support in total ???!!! This is your problem guys &#8211; you all convince eachother you have a point to make but you have such a limited knowledge of what you are protesting about you lose all credibility with people that do.  I&#8217;m sure all of the chemical cleaners that had to be used to remove the treaclely gloop you sprayed all over the front of that beautiful sandstone building will go a long way to helping the environment.  Go home and stick to what you know &#8230; i.e. how to cook a good lentil curry and not a lot else &#8230; you shower of useless tramps.</p>

	  <p>Trying to cause a pile up on a motorway is considered positive? Really? It would be very easy, but I&#8217;ll tell you why I won&#8217;t do it, because it will attract extremists like you have that will do anything to cause harm.  So get off your high horse,, people do care, just not about the way you decided to implement.</p>

	  <p>The disguises are because the Police film legitimate protestors in order to intimidate.  So many civil liberties have been invaded in recent times.  The police and government make it very difficult to protest these days.<br />
We need to stand up the profit at all cost attitude that is destroying our world.  Shall we all just sit back and watch our world destroyed by greedy profiteers.  Deep sea drilling in the arctic as it melts is disgusting!  </p>

	  <p>Even excluding the motorway incident, your camp have intimidated, vandalised etc.  There is no excuse for that is there? I appreciate there is a problem with the world and the climate, but there are much better, safer and legal ways of getting this message heard, and this would be more respected by the public who will be more receptive to these messages, would you not agree?</p>

	  <p>Not only are you blind but deaf and dumb. I&#8217;m done speaking to you morons. I&#8217;m glad you have left.. Your last post about taking action as the only way forward &#8211; that is the type of extremist thinking that gives environmentalists a bad name. So well done, you have achieved nothing here. Take your direct action if you have to, ultimately it will land you in jail, and that&#8217;s where you deserve to be if you can justify trying to harm innocent motorists.</p>

	  <p>Democracy has become a corporate sham.  How many people demonstrated to try and stop the War in Iraq?  Decisions are made now not for the populations benefit but for the most powerful corporations on Earth.  The media will no doubt in future be further de-regulated to obscure any possible glimmer of truth.</p>
<p>Many people see the truth I feel, but lack the spirit and energy to do anything about it!  Entertainment and diversions have taken over us all.  Perhaps direct action means you are truly living and standing up for what you believe in.  Rather than passively absorbing trashy TV and the quick jump to fame bullshit that has captured our youth! How did the suffragettes get the vote by asking nicely?</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t justify trying to throw oil on roads?  I actually said I don&#8217;t trust the official sources.  Why lie?   All I said was Should Climate camp which I am not a member of but was seriously considering joining go and speak to their MP.  Democracy is failing us, surely you can see that.  They are in the pockets of corporations.  Why did you lie about my post and start calling me a moron when I have only treated you with respect?  It is the tabloid press that are not able to talk honestly and degenerate into name calling, I thought you seemed quite intelligent.</p>
<p>As I said before, I do not trust official sources about the oil on the road it would have been too easy to set up to try and destroy this grass roots movements growing support. I remember Hillsborough and police sources giving untrue info to the media.</p>

	  <p>&#8221; I am not a climate camper but it does now seem that direct action is now the only way&#8221;</p>
<p>Direct action so far has meant vandalism, terrorising civilians, pouring oil on roads (whether you believe in it or not), criminal damage and the list goes on.  This is extreme in my eyes. Whether all is true or not, I myself have witnessed some, and if you support these methods (like some hAve admitted any action is necessary) then this is extremist.  No one has yet to condon these actions.</p>
<p>So no lies, all from these messages over the past week. </p>

Work hard, get yourselves into a position of respect, SHOW some respect to those whose support you are trying to win rather than just making peoples&#8217; lives more difficult for which you&#8217;ll get no thanks, or respect &#8230;  Do something productive rather than destructive &#8211; after all, isn&#8217;t that fundamentally what you want the companies you are protesting about to do&#8230;?</p>

	  <p>” I am not a climate camper but it does now seem that direct action is now the only way”</p>
<p>Yes I did say that and then you got very excited and started calling me a moron.  Why was that?  I did not say I agreed with pouring oil on a motorway anywhere?</p>
<p>I agree with peaceful and artistic direct action.  I admire those you get off their couches to do something about their beliefs and convictions rather than continue to passively absorb the nonsence on TV.  We are amusing ourselves to death!</p>
<p>What do you do except moan about Climate campers which seems to be a bit of a full time job for you this evening.  Not being paid by any chance to do this?  Just a thought. I have a bit of an understanding of how PR works and there seems to be a fair amount of co-ordinated anti-climate camp activity this time around.  Perhaps they caused a bit of a stir last time.</p>

	  <p>Even excluding the motorway incident there have been other criminal acts. It&#8217;s worrying that you have this fixation that there is some conspiracy here, or that I am paid by someone to do this.. I am strongly opposed as a resident of a city which I live in, which was invaded by a group of criminals hiding behind a set of moral issues who have done nothing but cAused anarchy in the city. So I can assure you there is no conspiracy here, and can only suggest you address this paranoia you seem to have.  If I was PR why would I post comments on a site hardly anyone visits? </p>
<p>We have something in common, I also agree in peaceful and artistic direction, unfortunatley this had not been the case.</p>

	  <p>I had to comment on this one it made me really chuckle!</p>
<p>&#8220;Work hard, get yourselves into a position of respect&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>I think we might have a bit of a different idea as to what we respect.<br />
The problem with the world is the corporate profit at any cost to the environment, people and animals.  Am I meant to respect organisations that continue to lay off staff and bring in part-time workers to maximise profits and spend the money on developing their brand.  Am i meant to respect a CEO who employs sweatshop labour in the third world, ie most multi-national companies to maximise profits.  </p>
<p>The economy is dead&#8230;.all we have left is the natural world&#8230;..All public money has trickled up and not down and still people believe the nonsance provided by the unreality of the constant invasion of televisual images in their lives.</p>
<p>What am I meant to respect&#8230;.Get a good job and become a CEO then you can be a part of a process, where the whole picture actually just rapes natural resources, enslaves the third world&#8230;.</p>
<p>I hope your very proud!</p>

	  <p>Oh and coordinated anti climate camp activity &#8211; that comes from you invading this city, and people not agreeing.  The only coordination has been sparked by climate camps actions over this week. Again no conspiracy, no ones been paid. We are just angry with your group.</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m off, to leave you idealists to plan for next years stunt.  Try harder and reject these extremists in your camp and be peaceful, we might be more responsive if you did that.</p>

	  <p>I agree with you protests should be peaceful and creative but need to be as large as is possible!  Any activist will tell you that often peaceful demos are sabotaged by infiltrators paid to do so in order to create negative media that does not focus on the issues.</p>

	  <p>The police film protestors because they know certain ones are likely to break the law.  Your own literature explains that is why you cover your faces because people may not want to jeopardise their jobs if they are involved in &#8220;Direct Action&#8221; and don&#8217;t want to get identified and caught and prosecuted.  The police are not interest in intimidating protestors &#8211; they are interested in maintaining law and order.  And unlike protestors they do not publish the pictures and identities of those they photograph on a website called fitwatch. Unlike protestors, the pictures they take are subject to strict legislative regulation by a democratically elected government.</p>
<p>Protestors decide undemocratically, to break which laws suit them, they then complain when the authorities use democratic lawful processes to assist with the inevitable arrest and prosecution of protestors.</p>
<p>Prostestors then whinge about this and claim it is &#8220;unfair&#8221;.  The real reason you hate this is because it starkly reminds protestors of the fact that they are in the irrelevant minority which is why they have to protest in the first place.  The sad reality is they are simply too immature and unwilling to engage in the political process.  Comparing themselves to the suffragetes or Ghandi is insulting and ridiculous principally because both put themselves, not others at risk.  When was the last time a soapdodger flung themselves in front of Brans Hatch?</p>

	  <p>Again they are probably not paid, but encouraged by the material on this website that implies encouragement for people to come and take things as far  as they wish.  This attracts these splinter groups but as long as climate camp do not condon it, they are just as guilty.  And from what I have seen, the majority of the camp has been involved so I do not think the intention was to be peaceful. </p>

<p>Please watch the great documentary &#8220;taking liberties&#8221; if anybody is interested.  The peoples right to protest as well as a number of other civil liberties have been taken away in recent times.  Of course it&#8217;s intimidating to be filmed by police when you are peacefully demonstrating which is our democratic right.</p>

	  <p>Just a quick few points about this supposedly successful protest.</p>
<p>Its funny how quickly the climate camp bunch denies all knowledge or connection, even as far as dis-own, to those people who cause trouble whether its an oil spill or a broken window or even idiots who think they have something to gain from super-gluing themselves to barriers/door etc.<br />
the fact that this was organised by the climate camp they should take all responsibility for all the idiots that turn up claiming they are with you and not conveniently dis-own these individuals as soon as trouble starts. this is worse than politician who change their minds every two seconds. Quite pathetic really &#8220;you are one of us till we dont like you&#8221;</p>
<p>Another point, as mention by the climate camp bunch, RBS is majority owned by the tax-paying public and realistically what was to gain by shutting down the place for a day or two?  What was gained is a whopping bill to pay for damages to buildings, police assistance, extra security and loss of working hours for thousands of people and guess who is going to fork that bill, RBS or the tax paying public owners, PICK ONE!. So the thousands or possibly millions of pounds lost will have to be made back somehow and most likely by lending more to these big fuel companies.  Like all banks they make money by lending money to others or in this case big oil companies, ITS BUSINESS!  its not as if RBS is lending money to drug lords to manufacture cocaine or any illegal substances.<br />
I can almost say with certainty that the banks or oil companies after this protest will continue as usual and things wont change.<br />
These protest if anything should be aimed at regulators and government as they allow these companies operate in these ways under the law so they are doing nothing illegal unlike some of the climate camp group!<br />
to be honest if its not the banks lending to these oil companies it will be someone else.<br />
The few individuals at these protest is not going to change the THIRST that the HUMAN RACE has for fossil fuels so as long as this thirst is present these oil companies will prosper.</p>
<p>To me this was not a successful protest and far from it.  What was portrayed the last few days to the general public was a bunch of people, possibly even go as far as called NEDs, who had nothing better to do with their lives other than sit outside a bank smashing windows and generally causing trouble. 9 out of 10 people in the general public would think like that so the message from this protest was not successful.<br />
Dont get me wrong i believe people has a right to protest, this is a free country after all.<br />
Its always good to stand up for just causes and I admire those who do but this time the few &#8220;dis-owned&#8221; individuals that was causing trouble spoilt the message.  Its the execution of how the message is passed thats important not the trouble or the number of people present.  Better arrangement or even screening your members might be a good idea for your next protest.<br />
If this was peaceful protest and no trouble was caused, you would have got the public sympathy even backing to this just cause but instead you have portrayed a ned-like image.</p>
<p>on another note dont you people have jobs? thats alot of time to take off work if you do!</p>

<p>What a way to look like a bunch of pseudo terrorists rather than draw attention to a worthwhile cause, this sort of behaviour isn&#8217;t going to endear the public to climate change. You&#8217;ve succeeded in being hated more by the public than RBS, which is rather impressive!</p>

	  <p>This blog has been reported to the Lothian &amp; Borders Police.  They instructed that numerous complaints were received of oil on Lothian Road on Monday afternoon causing the council to deploy cleaning staff to clean the road as an emergency.</p>
<p>This act could have left people injured or worse and they now have the video evidence of the people involved.</p>
<p>Maybe this will also go some way to getting to the bottom of who or what caused the spills on the A8/A720 roads.</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s some confusion here. The video in question technically isn&#8217;t on this blog. It&#8217;s hosted by YouTube and just embedded here.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should read the info about the protest which explained that this wasn&#8217;t oil, but molasses.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Council have acknowledged that this wasn&#8217;t oil otherwise they&#8217;re continuing to spread misinformation!</p>

<p>No confusion at all and I thank you for your input.  </p>
<p>The video is posted here in the blog and is made by the same media that filmed your climate camp videos; therewfore it is directly linked to this.  You&#8217;re obvioulsy a smart person therefore I won&#8217;t insult your intelligence any longer.</p>
<p>Molasses, oil, deisel, what ever it was.  It was a slippery substance and it leaked onto the road therefore the actiosn of the individuals created a hazard to the main, public road.  </p>
<p>This breaches the Road Safety Act and the police need to prove it so.  As mentioned, after speaking with LBP they instructed me, persoanlly, that they are fully aware of the situation and are inevstigating it fully</p>

<p>I think some PR lessons are required if you want public awareness and backing.  Try googling PR tips and you will find a wealth of information.</p>
<p>Also I noticed everyone in those videos are wearing some white plastic polythene type suits.  how and where do you think plastic comes from? it certainly doesnt grow on trees, majority is from crude oil or other &#8216;evil&#8217; like substances. not very eco friendly using them, could take 1000&#8242;s of years to decompose. Purchasing these suits is funding and supporting these oil companies.  Also the glue used to glue yourselves together come from factories no doubt emitting toxic chemicals into our atmosphere, again supporting these companies and not very eco friendly.<br />
Takes some tips from proper hippies, relax smoke some whacky baccy and no trouble would have been caused. use chains and ropes and dress up in clothes made from natural materials. dont dress up in plastic and use dodgy chemicals when the message you are &#8220;trying&#8221; to potray relates to climate, oil, and generally about protecting our planet and people.<br />
I am not having a dig as I believe everyone needs to know what climate change and fossils fuels are doing to us and the planet but as said before at least make it look eco-friendly what you are doing. Digging a hole in the mud to crap in is eco-friendly but wearing/using plastics is NOT.<br />
I believe in this just cause but you have a long way to go before you are going to be liked by the public. Maybe a little more planning and try to exclude some of the trouble makers would make this go a long long way.<br />
Good luck in your next protest.</p>

	  <p>So no comment on the +£100 billion of taxpayers money RBS has loaned to Cairn? Cairn have a Market cap of £6.5 billion. I love it how you quietly ignore any objections to your blatant lies in the hope that it&#8217;ll somehow justify your militant activities. Not only are you all a bunch of posh kids playing anarchists you are clearly liars and a bit thick and detached from reality. Next time you come to Edinburgh may I suggest that you locate your camp in Wester Hailes? We&#8217;ll see how long you last. And get some jobs so you actually contribute to society rather than diverting under strain public funding to clean up all your acts of vandalism.</p>
