	  <p>Yes, there seems to be an uncomfortable silence around that particularly criminal action (the oil on the road). C&#8217;mon protesters, tell us why you want to kill us on our roads.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s about time your scum left Edinburgh alone.  Please do tell us all the address of your parents and I will bring hundreds of folk round to smash your house windows and generally make your life a misery.  You are nothing but a bunch of bone-idle, soap dodging layabouts, intent on violence, harassment, and intimidation.  You should be out working, earning a proper days wage and paying into the tax system to support this country, instead of acting like a lot of spoiled school children.  By the way, I hope all those arrested face a long jail term to reflect on their immature actions.</p>

	  <p>Having seen what a peaceful protest is,  I now have no sympathy for &#8220;peaceful&#8221; protests which &#8220;don&#8217;t require policing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite a police presence you have caused criminal damage,  intimidated staff and put people in real danger of physical harm.  If not for the police presence I dont know where you would draw the line with your criminal actions.</p>
<p>I think you should do everyone a favour,  go home and concentrate on making a difference.  Try and get into politics or club together and build some wind farms or something.</p>
<p>As it stands,  I think you have disgraced yourselves and anyone that stands up for environmental issues. You are behaving as though you are the only people with these concerns about the environment,  and as though you are &#8220;doing the world a favour&#8221; which you are not.</p>
<p>I echo previous posts which highlight what would happen if no one funded these power sources,  they would fail and as a result leave millions without power.  You are going about this all the wrong way.</p>
<p>NOW CAN SOMEONE FROM THE &#8220;CAMP FOR CLIMATE ACTION&#8221; PLEASE CONFIRM THE CRIMINAL DAMAGE THEY HAVE CAUSED AND NOT TRY TO IGNORE THESE ACTIONS.</p>

	  <p>Idiots, complete and utter idiots.</p>
<p>What good is going to be achieved by your reckless behavior?  </p>
<p>Yes, you have raised some awareness of the fact that banks (Not just RBS) fund organisations whose actions could be deemed as damaging to the environment.</p>
<p>Will the last few days make a difference?  Not at all.</p>
<p>All you have done is to turn public support against your cause.</p>
<p>By disrupting peoples daily life&#8217;s and causing danger to others, your immature actions have belittled your cause.</p>
<p>How many of you actually take climate change seriously?  Did you taken into account the increase of your carbon footprint when travelling to Edinburgh?  What about all the damage that has been caused?  Windows dont grow on trees and the ones that have been smashed at Gogarburn will need to be replaced &#8211; the transport alone will have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to calculate the effect your &#8216;peaceful protest&#8217; has had on the environment &#8211; I bet it is not a positive one.</p>
<p>To the protesters who have genuinely came to Edinburgh to raise awareness in a constructive manner &#8211; well done.</p>
<p>To the mindless idiots who have tagged along because they have nothing better to do/don’t have a job/are waiting to go back to uni/thought they would catch a bit of the festival (which RBS sponsor) &#8211; piss off home and have a serious look in the mirror at yourself and question your reasons for being here.  Grow up.</p>

	  <p>You have cost a charity money due to your actions today. By closing Edinburgh branches you have put our funds at risk as we were unable to bank money (not even an RBS account &#8211; we just use their corporate banking facilities (for free &#8211; thank you RBS and not to mention the thousands of pounds you have raised for us in the past)).<br />
I tried to discuss this issue with one of your protesters who was unwilling to listen &#8211; what a childish attitude &#8220;I&#8217;m right and you&#8217;re wrong and I won&#8217;t listen to you&#8221; &#8211; really making a difference?!?!?<br />
And dressing in black plastic? Very enviromentally friendly!</p>

Hopefully those arrested will rot in a cell for many, many years.  climatecamp are nothing but scum and are not welcome in Edinburgh.</p>

	  <p>The police need to erect a 15ft steel fence around the camp and let them rot in the camp for weeks.  From the video, it is quite clear they are nothing but workshy layabouts, drawing the dole and expecting everyone else to take responsibility for their lives.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking &#8220;climate camp&#8221; isn&#8217;t an organisation but a movement of individuals.</p>
<p>Some of these people have addressed specific concerns or questions on the blog. However, much of what is being posted doesn&#8217;t pose questions; it simply states personal opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinion.</p>

	  <p>Simon &#8211; why endanger lives on the Edinburgh roads with vegetable oil poured on it?  Why the disruption to the Edinburgh folk?  Why the need for vandalism by smashing windows with golf balls?  Why have folk been arrested connected with your group?  </p>

	  <p>Police from all over Scotland have been drafted in because of the immature, illegal actions of climatecamp.  What do you think that does to the climate with all these extra police officers having to drive many miles to Edinburgh?  climatecamp = immature, layabout, soap-dodging parasites.</p>

	  <p>Simon I question your statement that the &#8220;Climate Camp&#8221; is a movement of individuals. </p>
<p>There were statements that RBS had lied about issuing an invite to meet with the leaders of the camp. And that no such invite had been received.</p>
<p>As such climate camp recognises that there are &#8220;leaders&#8221; and therefore this is not a &#8220;movement of individuals&#8221; where there would surely be no structure or heirarchy.</p>

	  <p>@tony &#8211; As you say, I wasn&#8217;t involved in those actions so can&#8217;t answer questions about their motivations. </p>
<p>However, I can say that sometimes illegal actions are justified in preventing a bigger crime form taking place. For example, by stopping RBS lend money to companies that destroy people&#8217;s lives around the world a bigger crime (i.e. death and damage to the environment) is being prevented.</p>
<p>In fact British courts have already set a precedent by accepting this defence by acquitting Greenpeace activists. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace#The_Kingsnorth_court_case" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace#The_Kingsnorth_court_case</a> for more details.</p>

	  <p>Simon &#8211; you think illegal actions are justifiable &#8211; NEVER.  You wasn&#8217;t involved in the actions of the RBS &#8211; but you condemn them.  So why can&#8217;t you condemn the actions of those individuals associated with climatecamp?  Come on Simon &#8211; condemn the illegal action of the maggots associated with climatecamp!!  Otherwise you are nothing but a low life piece of scum.</p>

	  <p>Simon,</p>
<p>Just because you say boo-hoo I wasn&#8217;t involved in those actions, it doesn&#8217;t absolve you of any responsibility for it. You are part of, and a representative of this unruly bunch and therefore, whether you like it or not, you are all tarred with the same brush. You are not making a difference by way of these actions &#8211; you are just alienating the vast majority of people who may have had some sympathy with your cause.</p>
<p>You stated that you were here to cause disruption and disruption you have caused. I&#8217;m afraid that this has backfired greatly against your cause. Just look at all the negative posts on this blog. </p>
<p>No one likes you or what you stand for.</p>
<p>Goodbye and good riddance I say. I hope that an overworked and underpaid police officer leaves their mark upon you before you return home to your third world swamp!!</p>

<p>Hey. Climate Camp is very much a movement of individuals. See the How We Work section of the website: <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/get-involved/how-we-work" rel="nofollow">http://climatecamp.org.uk/get-involved/how-we-work</a></p>
<p>We could get tied up here but the Camp does have no leaders so it would be impossible for RBS to issue an invitation. What often happens is that organisations or the Police will email one of the generic contact addresses. If no email has ever been received then it&#8217;s possible no invitation was extended.</p>

	  <p>Hmm simon, by your logic we should take &#8216;direct action&#8217; against climate camp then for the actions they took today, since it would be &#8216;justified&#8217; as you lot have put many peoples lives at risk.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t be so stupid, you&#8217;re getting on dangerous grounds when you try and justify illegal actions for the greater good&#8230; Sound familiar?</p>

	  <p>@Tony &#8211; The British judicial system has ruled that illegal actions are indeed justifiable in certain situations.</p>
<p>However, you and a few others in this comment thread seem intent on ignoring my points and simply directing quite offensive remarks at me.</p>
<p>While I definitely welcome debate, the level of abuse from many of the negative posts simply undermine some of the points you&#8217;re making and cause offense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to discuss the finer points of activism, politics and climate change but I&#8217;m not prepared to face such accusations as &#8220;scum&#8221; or &#8220;maggot&#8221; which have been directed at me.</p>

	  <p>Simon &#8211; you say illegal actions are justifiable &#8211; therefore, what you perceive as &#8220;illegal&#8221; actions by the RBS are also justifiable?  You can&#8217;t have it both ways.  If illegal actions are justifiable &#8211; you also support the RBS.  If &#8220;illegal actions&#8221; by the RBS are not acceptable, you also condemn the actions of climatecamp.</p>
<p>Simon &#8211; what is it to be?  Support the RBS, or condemn your member?  No two ways about it.</p>

	  <p>You think you are all so clever and brave but how pathetic you truly are. </p>
<p>Take the bunch that glued themselves in the car park. The rain started to come down and they then begged the police to help release them &#8211; so tough, so brave.</p>
<p>How about the bunch down at the docks. They gave up because they were getting wet &#8211; aw diddums. They even took wateproofs from the Energy Company employees.</p>
<p>Then of course there are the hot denials about the oil poured over the roadway, risking lives. That is the big big risk you take with your get out of &#8220;we have no leaders&#8221;. In other words you are simply an out of control mindless bunch of yobs.</p>
<p>Oh by the way, why was there a big bunch of your people shopping at Tescos in Hermiston? Had they forgotten about their links to RBS!!!</p>
<p>Fickle fickle fickle</p>
<p>Think about it when you&#8217;re heading off tomorrow in your cars, trains, planes and buses; back to ma and pa and your constantly topped up bank accounts &#8211;  how many of those are with RBS, I wonder&#8230;.</p>

	  <p>Simon,</p>
<p>You seem to pick on posts that are easy to reply to whilst intent on ignoring those that challenge your cause.  Is it because it is too difficult for you to justify putting the lives of innocent motorists at risk to get attention?</p>
<p>And before you reply saying they do not represent your organisation. Unfortunatley they do, because ultimately the organisers should be responsible and they have not condon these actions and instead, imply encouragement of these more extreme actions.</p>

	  <p>Simon &#8211; there is no British legal system.  You are obviously English and assume Scotland is a county of England.  Scotland has its own legal system, different to England.  Remind your members that when taking action in Scotland, because the Scottish law is more powerful to the police taking action against the scum of climatecamp.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;In fact British courts have already set a precedent by accepting this defence by acquitting Greenpeace activists. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace#The_Kingsnorth_court_case" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace#The_Kingsnorth_court_case</a> for more details.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the rest of the Muppets in the Climate Camp are as stupid as you. </p>
<p>Scotland is not the same Legal Jurisdiction as E&amp;W and the case to which you refer was raised under a Criminal Damage Act that does not apply in Scotland. </p>
<p>Here in Scotland, your criminal chums will be prosecuted for the Common Law Crime of Malicious Mischief.</p>
<p>In any event, a case decided in an inferior court in a single jurisdiction can never reise a general precedent for &#8220;British&#8221; courts.</p>
<p>Hurry up and bugger off home to mummy and daddy in the (English) home counties.</p>

	  <p>CLIMATE CAMP 2010 PROPAGANDA VIDEO DAY 1</p>
<p>Tell me why doesn&#8217;t your video show the side roads around the RBS crammed with your polluting cars and the 3 large hire diesel vans which you hired to bring your equipment to the site.<br />
Why doesn&#8217;t the video show the damage to the side roads that your vehicles have caused with being parked on the grass verge and destroying  the plants and grass and now doubt contaminating the earth as 99% of them looked in complete disrepair and will no doubt be pissing oil everywhere.<br />
Why doesn&#8217;t the video show the 3 hours I had to sit and wait because not one of your so called reasonable humanitarian team members would let me past to my house while you blocked the whole road up with your conveniently hired diesel polluting vans  while dumping your crap in the nearest field .<br />
Why doesn&#8217;t the video show all the car jammed roads around Edinburgh caused by your so called peaceful protest causing nothing but anger and outrage not least the 100% increase in emissions.<br />
You make me sick !!! utterly sick !!! This so called peaceful demo has caused nothing but misery and despair for the people of Edinburgh. You are nothing but a selfish bunch of piss taking hypocrites.<br />
I can only express my utter disgust at the members of your camp who thought it was a clever idea to pour an oil like substance on the roads  of Edinburgh, you should consider yourselves very fortunate that nobody was killed or seriously hurt by your ludicrous actions, had it have been my wife and son that would have been caught in this&#8230;. well all I can say is you are one lucky man.</p>

	  <p>I&#8217;m so glad some people care enough to do something about out of control corporates that are destroying our world and keeping half of the world in slavery.</p>
<p>Want to know what is really going on in the world.  Stop watching the spectacle and believing the lies. Stop watching and start living.  Climate camp I applaud you.</p>
<p>Watch the following speech if you are interested to know the truth of the world today.  Their comes a point where silence is guilt!</p>

	  <p>What a great looking day out.  I have no doubt that the oil on the road was committed by corporates to try and put a spanner in this growing movement.  I&#8217;m sure the Sun newspaper will have a field day.  Many people are wise to the corporate scum that think only of their bottom line at the expense of people, animals and our environment.

	  <p>Steven and Dave &#8211; what do you think of the 17 arrested for mindless vandalism and violence? What do you think would have happened to a happy family driving to Edinburgh for the festival had they skidded on your oil spill?  What do you think to those that smashed windows and glued locks at various locations?  Steven and Dave, are you quite happy to post your address so the normal public can come round and pour oil over your driveway, smash your windows with golf balls, invade the privacy of your home, and superglue your locks?</p>

	  <p>I was working in a superstore  today Monday 23/8/10 when a trio of your &#8220;activists&#8221; tried to buy multiple packs of superglue. As is the law I asked them for identification to verify their ages which they could not supply.They then poured out a torrent of snide comments and left but one of the number came back and called me a jobsworth to which I replied t least I have a job.He backed off looking bewildered at this and left the store followed by the laughter of all the customers who had heard the exchanges. If you intend to make any headway in you campaigning you might start with advising your followers when it is advisable to zip yer lip.</p>

	  <p>Dear climate camp<br />
               I was disheartened for several years recently due to ,as I viewed it , todays youth&#8217;s seeming inability,unwillingness to use civil disturbances in protest at decisions made over this worlds future. You have today and also at the G20 given me hope that the MAN isn&#8217;t on top and winning without any competition. YOU ARE TOMORROWS HEROES , I myself led a 10,000 student strong protest in Glasgow many years ago ( Thatchers years )retaining our free education and believe it was one of my greatest deeds. In years to come keep your resolve and never forget how much your freedom is worth and the civil riots and protests that where necessary to ensure these freedoms. Do not allow anyone tell you that riots are wrong , riots are heard when all else fails ! Brilliant minds can not be tamed or beaten down !</p>

	  <p>Wow this is a rather unproductive thread. As with any group fuelled by passion but lacking wisdom they took action that gained attention, but lacked value.</p>
<p>We are all hypocrites at some point, so please do not call others one when we are all one at one time or another.</p>
<p>I do agree overall all though, there was no value in those actions or the activities being undertaken to gain &#8216;awareness&#8217; for climate change.</p>
<p>@Tony, please stop asking for the parents address: that is no more mature than the groups random acts of misdirected social unrest.</p>
<p>@Simon: Want to save the planet? Get an education, join a fortune 500 company, be successful and direct it from the inside. If you manage to keep your view of morality after the education, and the pay checks, then create real change. All that&#8217;s happened today is risking innocent people’s lives, and given some people some work in repairing the damage&#8230; good job on supporting the economy, kind of missed the point on the climate though&#8230;</p>

	  <p>&#8220;random acts of misdirected social unrest&#8221; &#8211; are you a middle manager in Local/Central Government or an idle politico? &#8211; nobody else would pen such a phrase rather than simply describing these idiots&#8217; activities as random acts of petty vandalism or crass stupidity.</p>

	  <p>@Edinburger, I am neither one of those – you may want to work on how you generalize people. And here I thought your earlier response was one of the more informed ones.</p>
<p>What prompted me to post is people who believe they are taking the moral high ground by berating, threatening and insulting others.</p>
<p>Make informed and constructive criticisms of those you disagree with (which you were doing up until the mummy and daddy part), it gets you further.</p>
<p>The threats and insults posted here are no more creative then the “random acts of social unrest” I mentioned above&#8230;</p>
<p>I do hope the police are there in force too, and that the courts decide the best next steps for those they arrest&#8230; left to the unruly mobs posting here it looks like they would be up for an old fashion hanging.</p>
<p>Take a look at recent events in Canada for an example of both how to handle and not handle activists. They hosted two events: the G8 and the G20. The former had peaceful protests and no incidents, the other, a series of poor judgments in policing and riots. Police where there for both, and had two different outcomes. Why is that?</p>
<p>People who are frusterated on both sides acheive nothing.</p>

	  <p>Tony &#8211; illegal actions are never justified? Where have you been for the last century? Do you have any idea at all about the history of civil disobedience and social movements? Obviosly not, you ignorant swine. And as for all the criticism about the video not showing our illigal actions &#8211; as stated in the title, this was a video showing clips from day 1 on the camp, the action did not occur until the last day you blubbering fools. And we have put out plenty of footage showing the action, and I for one am proud of my participation in that illegal action. I will have something to tell my grandchildren when they ask the question &#8216;when the world was burning and everyone knew about it, what did you do Grandad&#8217;? you on the other hand, along with all you other time-rich layabouts with nothing better to do but vent from your amrchairs, will have squat diddly to say, inviting scorn from your unfortunate prodigy who will inherit a world of shit. Right, back to work, my leave is all used up on the camp, now I muct get on with contributing to the economy.</p>
