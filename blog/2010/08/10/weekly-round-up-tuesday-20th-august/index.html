  <h1>Weekly Round-up: Tuesday 20th August</h1>
  
  <p>The big round-up news this week is the special call out for help needed ahead of this year&#8217;s camp. It&#8217;s a bit of a long post but to get you in the mood we&#8217;ve embedded an inspiring  film below so watch and read on for how to get involved.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="550" height="330" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-md598WLIL4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="550" height="330" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-md598WLIL4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Most of the work for the<a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/"> Camp for Climate Action </a>takes place in small working groups. These working groups <a href="http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/get-involved/working-groups">cover a wide-range of areas and activities</a> including Welcome &amp; Tranquility, Media, Kids Space, Plumbing, Entertainment and more.</p>
<p>In the run up to each Camp working groups issue a call-out for final help to ensure that everything turns out a success. Below is a list of all the things you can get involved with &#8211; some quick and easy, others require more effort, but all vital for the smooth running and success of the Camp.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve been wondering how you can get more involved in the Camp, then here&#8217;s how you can&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Welcome &amp; Tranquility Group</strong></p>
<p>Welcome &amp; Tranquility Group request anyone interested in bottom lining Tranquility and Welcome activities and anyone to carry out a skill-share in mediation skills before the camp too. To help out contact process [@] climatecamp .org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Site Group</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Blackboards</strong></em> &#8211; The Site Group is currently looking for someone who could construct two large, freestanding blackboards? Unless anyone knows what happened to the beautiful one with the roof from Heathrow pictured below:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Climate Camp Notice Board by davidhc, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidhc/1650433241/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2348/1650433241_efaeb258b6.jpg" alt="Climate Camp Notice Board" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>If anyone can help produce ones as durable and gorgeous as this, it would be great!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Toilets, gate-duty and greywater</strong></em>: Individual neighbourhoods are reminded that they will be responsible for contributing to the running of the  camp by taking their turn on toilet and gate duty and helping out with greywater. Also, if anyone would like to learn about or help out with greywater then please get in touch with the Site Group. And there is also a need to source sawdust for the loos, and it would  make most sense to do this in Scotland</li>
<li><em><strong>Fire lanes:</strong></em> Two people are needed to help with setting out fire lanes on the swoop. This important work taking the site will only take a few  hours, and tools materials etc will be on site. Anyone interested should  contact Kevin at kevin.eddy100 [at] btinternet.com</li>
<li><em><strong>Plumbing</strong></em>: The Site Group&#8217;s plumbing team need people with *any* sort of plumbing experience &#8211; field plumbing, house plumbing, any encounters with water &amp; pipes counts! We&#8217;re also after people who are enthusiastic<br />
but without experience &#8212; on-the-job training available!</li>
<li><em><strong>Visuals</strong></em>: The visuals sub group could do with a few extra pairs of hands in the run up the camp. The best ways to help would be to either come to the<br />
Creation Lab event on the 14th &#8211; 15th August at Pop Up Studios in Lewes<br />
or email Sophie Lewis  and she can let people know what still<br />
needs doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone is able to help out or  take on any of these activities then please  get in touch with the Site Group by contacting site [at] climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment Group</strong></p>
<p>Climate Camp&#8217;s Entertainment Group needs the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone to bottom a line curating a small impromptu stage stage at camp</li>
<li> for fringe acts and people from camp who want to play</li>
<li> someone to bottom line building a tripod for a small impromptu stage at camp</li>
<li> overall bottom liner for entertainments at camp</li>
<li> musicians, poets, dancers and general performers</li>
<li> people to talk to comedians and fringe acts and persuade them to play at camp</li>
<li> outreach people to get people to come to the ents at camp</li>
<li> More people to join the group!</li>
</ul>
<p>To help out and for more info contact entertainments [at] climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Media Team</strong></p>
<p>The Media Team would love people to get involved right now! Previous media experience is not necessary, although obviously a bonus! They use a &#8216;buddying-up&#8217; technique for anyone who does not feel confident in any particular task to enable fast learning on the job!</p>
<p>Scottish activists would be great as most of the media will be Scotland</p>
<p>Specific Media Team requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who want to contact journalists by phoning and meeting up with key journalists and publications, getting them interested in Climate Camp and our the issues being covered by the Camp, offering articles, etc&#8230;.</li>
<li>people to give media skillshare&#8217;s throughout August (media experience is necessary for this one)</li>
<li>people to help write at least a couple of press releases during August and deal with resulting conversations with journalists</li>
<li>people who want to do print, tv or radio interviews with journalists</li>
<li>people who will be attending the camp and want to join the media team in all its work: specifically on the day of the &#8216;swoop&#8217;, the &#8216;set-up day&#8217; and the &#8216;day of action&#8217;!</li>
</ul>
<p>To get involved contact press [at] climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Kids Space</strong></p>
<p>The Kids Space group generally needs enthusiastic people who want to plan and who will be at the camp to do workshops, help with workshops or just generally play around. If anyone has any workshop ideas and would like to share them then get in touch contact kids [at] climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>Meetings Group</strong></p>
<p>The Meetings Group are looking for people who can help out with facilitating meetings at this year&#8217;s camp &#8211; this could be the camp-wide spokes meetings, helping out neighbourhoods who don&#8217;t have enough people or the skills to facilitate meetings or to help out any working groups as needed.</p>
<p>If you are interested please could email meetings [at] climatecamp.org.uk asap (even if you have already signed up to do facilitation!) and tell us your: name, email, phone number, what neighbourhood are you in &amp; what days you plan on being at camp</p>
<p>It would also be good if you could give an idea of your level of experience. Like the MEdia Team, a buddy system will be running where less confident people can be paired up with more experienced facilitators.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for&#8230;?</p>

	  <p>I strongly advise you not to get on the roads around Gogarburn as if you impede my way to work on Monday I will not be happy, this job is the only way I support my family, I am paid by the hour and I will not take too kindly to those who stand in the way of me trying to earn enough money so I can feed my family&#8230;..</p>

	  <p>You are all such douchbags&#8230; seriously, go protest about something that actually matters.</p>
<p>As humans, YOU are the main cause of global heating and carbon emissions.  YOUR actions are costing the taxpayers a lot more money than they needed to spend due to having to police YOUR camp.  YOU use electricity, which will be sourced from coal and oil. YOU are the problem, not companies.  Companies only exist to supply demand, and while YOU exist, there will be demand.  </p>
<p>So if you really cared about global warming, I suggest you go dig a hole and live in it, in the dark.</p>
