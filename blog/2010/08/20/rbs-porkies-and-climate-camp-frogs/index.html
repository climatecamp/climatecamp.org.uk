  <h1>RBS Porkies and Climate Camp Frogs</h1>
  
  <p>It doesn&#8217;t really surprise me, but it&#8217;s good to spot where RBS is choosing to lie today. Their little web of deceit keeps turning, even while we set up our action camp opposite their shiny fortress.</p>
<p>The first and biggest whopper, is how great they are at funding renewable energy, and that this means we haven&#8217;t done our homework and should go camp in someone else&#8217;s back garden. But as the <a href="http://understory.ran.org/">Rainforest Action Nework</a> points out:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to financial market data compiled by Bloomberg, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An5boO47-RAedERERGs0X3dqWGZfaFVWcWFrYkd2TFE&amp;hl=en&amp;single=true&amp;gid=1&amp;output=html">RBS  ranked third </a>as financier for alternative energy companies in 2006.  In the period since the taxpayer bailout, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An5boO47-RAedERERGs0X3dqWGZfaFVWcWFrYkd2TFE&amp;hl=en&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html">RBS’  ranks a distant 19th</a>!&#8221;</p>
<p>So far from being a leader in green energy, RBS are frankly way, way down there. Plus, their investment in renewables has got worse since they became majority owned by the state.</p>
<p>Of course, they just fed the little line to the press, and it got reprinted, even though there&#8217;s no truth in it. Another one like that was the great one that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/aug/19/climate-camp-royal-bank-of-scotland">&#8216;RBS wanted to talk with the camp&#8217;s leaders, but we refused.&#8217;</a> Well, the first anyone heard about this offer was through the press, so we&#8217;re all a bit amazed that RBS already know the probably response.</p>
<p>That said, the time for talking is over. Activists from the First Nations in Canada, along with NGOs around the world, have spent years trying to convince to stop investing in the Tar Sands, as well as all other fossil fuels, even by turning up at RBS shareholders&#8217; meetings here in Edinburgh. <a href="http://understory.ran.org/2010/05/11/royal-bank-of-scotland-dodges-questions-on-indigenous-rights/">The Chairman responded</a>: “…our investments in the Tar Sands are so minimal that I don’t even know  what they are.” Wow. If I were a shareholder, I&#8217;d be worried about his inability to keep track of $18 billion.</p>
<p>The next lie is them taking credit for our lovely camp site, claiming that they showed us where to camp after we naughtily found our way onto their property. My recollection is closer to them calling security and the police, who decided not to enter the site when they saw how many people had managed to take the space without their knowing anything about what-so-ever. We&#8217;re stretching right across their land, and are setting up camp according to how we best see fit: in a way that&#8217;s most accomodating to our environment as well as ourselves.</p>
<p>On a final note, that evironment includes quite a few small frogs, which we&#8217;re taking care not to step on, and are returning to the clumps of trees where they belong.</p>

	  <p>Mike, </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to the Camp, and I do pay Council Tax too. The climate camp has no need of police. they&#8217;ve said so every time, so if the police choose to spend £6m for the 2008 camp or a few pennies for the 2009 one, the outcome is the same. Perhaps you should ask the police why they overspend.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m sure the day of action will get policed. Protests do. Are you suggesting nobody should ever protest about anything because of the tiny fraction of a percent it adds to police costs?</p>
<p>Whatever happens at the camp, it&#8217;s nothing compared to the amount of tax you&#8217;ve given to RBS in order to exacerbate climate change and take fat bonuses along the way. Which, in turn, is nothing compared to the costs of dealing with climate change if we don&#8217;t do something about it soon.</p>

That was a quick reply. maybe you could get a job in IT and pay your own WAY.  On the other hand, maybe you alreadt have one, based on the speed of your replt &#8211; Trace this email.</p>

	  <p>To Mike Harle</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a climate camp? Or have you formed your opinions mainly from media and newspapers you read.</p>
<p>I attended Kingsnorth in 2008 and Blackheath in 2009. Both times were educational, inspirational, peaceful and generally rather beautiful memories. Intelligent, empathetic, and empassioned, fully alive compassionate people and brave young souls doing all they can to &#8216;improve the situation&#8217; and having a great +ve impact, and working and living together in harmony.</p>
<p>Vicars, priests, business people, MPs, lawyers, doctors and entrepreneurs attended too.  You really are missing out!</p>
<p>The policing on the other hand was dire.  Huge wastefulness, police doing nothing, or intimidating people, on lavish overtime, and fossil consumption set to max. (eg hovering helicopters all night)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 51, had a great education, studied engineering at Cambridge and was on the Board of a thriving London consultancy until I resigned 5 years ago.  </p>
<p>The people who attend climate camp are good brave decent people. They pay their own way, know their own minds, clear up their own mess, and brighten the lives of everyone they encounter.  </p>
<p>I salute them.</p>
<p>Oh, and well said Dougal.</p>

	  <p>Yes!  All are welcome!  Not everyone who goes to climate camp has to be vegetarian or vegan, but since a lot of them are it is simplest (and lowest climate impact) to make all the food provided at the camp vegan.  This event is for everyone, and we all try to learn from and enrich one another regardless of diet, creed or background&#8230;</p>

	  <p>The peaceful fun loving, brave young souls caused £14000 worth of damage to the RBS building today, not to mention scaring one of the female employies half to death wehn they attempted to break into the building. Trouble makers who I bet all have bank accounts of some kind and live off mummy and daddy. Go home the majority of edinburgh folk dont want you here causing trouble in our city.</p>

	  <p>Dougal, </p>
<p>I cannot understand how you can justify saying &#8220;The climate camp has no need of police&#8221;.  There has already been criminal damage caused since Thursday, and your camp has been quoted as saying they will be carrying actions that are illegal.</p>
<p>Surely this means there IS justification for policing as you will be breaking the laws as you are obviously unable to protest peacefully, and seem to promote the use of non peaceful of illegal methods of getting your point across? </p>
<p>What I do not understand is what you are trying to achieve here, even if (and thats a very very small if) you get your way and the banks listen and withdraw funding to the oil, gas and coal industries, what do you think is going to happen? </p>
<p>Well I can tell you what would happen. Withdrawing the funding means these companies will fail.  If they fail, who will provide electricity?  No one &#8211; because we have no resources at the moment able to sustain the world. We do not have enough wind turbines, solar panels etc etc.</p>
<p>And how do you make things like solar panels, wind turbines &#8211; you need to mine, smelt and manufacture.  All requiring electricity, and surprise surprise, you can only get that from these power stations you have closed down. </p>
<p>Even if the world decides to rely on wind turbines, you get idiots who start complaining that they are an eye sore etc etc.. You just cant win. </p>
<p>What your issue should be is the issue that there is not enough focus on renewable energy, and this is an issue with companies that supply energy at the moment.  They should be investing more money into sustainable energy production.  And they can only do this if they have money to do so. </p>
<p>And what about yourselves, can you tell me that all of you at the camp are living in a sustainable manner?  Did you not take transport of some sort to get to the venue? Did you not use things like mobile phones to organise this (which im not sure whether you are aware, but contains a very rare material that is mined?) </p>
<p>So please, stop trying to make out that Climate Camp is trying to save the world because you are not.  You are all so selfish, and all so hypocritical and its sad to see so many of you wasting your time, being a nuisance and causing taxpayers more money to cover the costs of policing you.</p>

	  <p>Oh by the way, the material I was talking about is Coltan.</p>
<p>Look it up. </p>
<p>And by your logic, because you have bought mobile phones, you are funding the mining of this material, which by your logic, means the blood of many who die mining this material is in your hands. The blood of many in conflict zones caused by this material is in your hands. </p>
<p>So unless you really believe in your cause, you should all recycle your mobile phones.  Oh and that also goes for your laptops, and tents which are made of plastic (which comes from Oil if you didnt know) and you cars, and homes and the list goes on and on and one.</p>

	  <p>well thanks, because of your decision to cause damage to the property at gogar today, the decision to close the on site nursery for the protection of children there was a correct one. Unfortunately for you the unintended consequence of this is that the parents who have to work (rather than swan about the country playing silly buggers and creating chaos as they don&#8217;t have a real life, only morals and ideals which somehow you can live off) as we have families to support, jobs to do, have had to detour miles around edinburgh for alternatives, most importantly disrupting the children and through the additional travel, creating more damage to the environment. you do not gain my support by distrupting innocent families in this way.</p>

	  <p>Your protests are a drain on UK Government resources which are less than zero to start with NO doubt the peaceful protest will result in a stramash and people getting hurt.</p>

<p>Are you people serious suggesting that a group of human beings has committed some form of hypocrisy? You mean they aren&#8217;t perfect eco-warriors who can magically float to Edinburgh on the backs of Giant Butterflies?</p>
<p>Wow, there go my expectations.</p>
<p>And I thought Climate Camp was all about being utterly perfect in every way shape and form. Turns out its just a load of hippies raising awareness about renewable energy on a massive scale, doing all those workshops, living communally, giving the local community a once-in-a-lifetime chance to have an eco-camp on their doorstep and go to all those free events, protesting against injustice, having the time of their lives, etc.</p>

	  <p>I am a Green voter but my aunt and sister both work at RBS. I think we all feel you guys are well meaning but whoever is pulling your chain and directing the traffic are just trying to jump on the bandwagon of attacking the bank after all its trouble. You say the bank is lying but for those of us whose families depend on it they have been great employers. I do hope your own attacks aren&#8217;t lies or half truths because all the made up stuff from that Uni down south made me have to justify my green beliefs in a way i never expected. I hope you arent making us just like another movement and politicians and lying just to get publicity.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;raising awareness about renewable energy on a massive scale, doing all those workshops, living communally, giving the local community a once-in-a-lifetime chance to have an eco-camp on their doorstep and go to all those free events, protesting against injustice, having the time of their lives, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounds great! Before I pack my bag though, my social conscience and moral compass are important to me (as they obviously are to you)so can you confirm&#8230;<br />
- we won&#8217;t be intimidating anyone<br />
- we won&#8217;t be limiting anyone&#8217;s freedom of movement, speech or belief<br />
- we won&#8217;t be damaging property of any person or organisation</p>
<p>Before your scoff, the last one&#8217;s really important to me because, as we&#8217;re all aware, the procurement of raw materials, manufacture of replacement property, transportation of that property, fitting and testing of that property has an impact on our environment which, of course, is contrary to what we&#8217;re campaigning for.</p>
<p>I excitedly await your reply!</p>

	  <p>I totally agree with where you&#8217;re coming from. The capitalist system is at fault. Social inequality, environmental destruction, global warming, consumerism, work culture, personal debt, &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>I applaud climate camp for making people sit bit and take notice and possibly even think about some of these issues for even 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with direct action as long as it is right action and the consequences and implication are fully thought through.</p>

	  <p>Leave the wildlife alone you MORON!  If your idea of sustainability is interfering with natures creatures by displacing them and then traumatising them by picking them up and moving them where you think they ought to be you need an education and quickly.  This more than anything makes it blindingly obvious you are simply protestors not environmentalists or ecologists and are quite frankly about as ignorant  as it gets when it comes to living in harmony with the environment.</p>
<p>Anyone with a brain would have realised that setting up a camp for hundreds of people where there is a large frog population is going to totally disrupt their habitat.  You should be prosecuted you imbeciles.  You are the environments worst nightmare come true.</p>

	  <p>Dear Bernard, your glee at saying you are stretching your delightful camp across RBS land is somewhat ill at odds with the legal and national customs of your host country.  Were you not so ignorant you would know that it is in fact &#8220;our&#8221; land not RBS&#8217;s.  You may be unaware but this &#8220;them and us&#8221;mentality is quite common in England which has different laws and culture. It is fortunately different in Scotland, where nobody actually owns land, the only thing the own is the title.  Additionaly since you are so keen to point out that RBS is 80% publicly owned you must in fact concede that it really is &#8220;our&#8221; land and doubly so.  Now that you and your friends have camped all across my and your land perhaps you would be good enough to refrain from damaging it and causing us all expense.</p>
<p>I should also imagine that the reason your (I really mean our) campsite is so lovely is because it is landscaped and paid for by the organisation you profess to despise. Please therefore enjoy our campsite at our expense but be aware you are not our guest.</p>
<p>As for anyone knowing anything about your arrival please give yourself a pat on the back.  You truly are a genius for having outsmarted the evil empire.</p>

	  <p>My own personal opinion &#8211; you &#8220;protesters&#8221; are a bunch of doped-up unemployed wasters who seem to think that taking drugs and dancing in a field to 80s German techno somehow aids your cause. The bank offered a face-to-face meet to give you a chance to air your greavances, and you turned it down in favour of causing criminal damage, trespasing and getting even further off your face on drugs. This is where your tax money is going, in benefits supporting you muppets and to the police who have to try and keep the peace. </p>
<p>To L&amp;B police &#8211; order 500 taser guns and deliver to St Andrew Square and Gogarburn, Royal Mile and wherever else you losers are planning your pathetic protests. Happy camping hippies, hope it rains!</p>

So please pack up and go, and consider your campaign a complete fail, because if anything, you have come out of this looking worse than the banks. You are all hypocrites, and your only real reason for your actions are for selfish reasons. And what is worse, you have put shame on environmentalists out there who are able to convey a message without violence, harm or terror, who will now be looked upon in the same light as you.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;We (the public) have heard you, we’ve seen you, and we don’t agree&#8221;.<br />
Really? You don&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s wrong to trash the environment and poison people? If it were your family forced from their homes and suffering with cancer, would you agree then? Would you write a polite letter to RBS and hope that would do did the trick? </p>
<p>&#8220;You are all hypocrites, and your only real reason for your actions are for selfish reasons.&#8221;<br />
Climate Camp activists are about as far as you can get from being selfish. They are doing this for indigenous people around the world who are loosing their homes and livelihoods and suffering life threatening disease due to fossil fuel industries that provide the energy to allow us to continue to live this unsustainable life. They&#8217;re doing it for the rising number of people affected by floods and other severe weather events and ultimately for you, since climate change will affect us all eventually. </p>
<p>You can sit there and criticise and carry on your daily lives as if there was no worry in the world, but one day you&#8217;ll look back and realise you should have done something &#8211;  just like the government and the banks will. Problem is, you don&#8217;t want to believe it now, because believing it means you have to take action and that&#8217;s just too much effort and you&#8217;ve got better things to do. Sadly, most people won&#8217;t do a thing until it&#8217;s too late.</p>

	  <p>Interesting how Climate Camp still avoid the questions raise above re your own damage to the climate cause by this camp alone &#8211; we all know you didn&#8217;t walk there, we all know lorries delivered your equipment, that the water you&#8217;re using (courtesty of your &#8216;hosts&#8217;) hasn&#8217;t come direct from a spring without any treatment, that you&#8217;re taking advantage of technology and equipment that isn&#8217;t &#8216;green&#8217;. </p>
<p>Out of interest, is superglue bio-degradable?! Have you sourced a special superglue that doesn&#8217;t give off toxins?! Let&#8217;s hope so, because no doubt from all you&#8217;ve said so far, you&#8217;re planning to use a lot of Monday.</p>
<p>Let He Who Is Without Sin Cast The First Stone!! </p>
<p>Go home and learn some negotiating skills, because causing £1,000s of damage trying to smash your way into offices (that are in theory owned by us all), intimidating those who are trying to earn a living, and causing disruption for small children really isn&#8217;t a great way to get your point listened to and considered. Have you actually thought about how that group of children will be affected? </p>
<p>We live in a democracy, if you have an issue, lobby the Government, and get them to legislate, really not worth lobbying the businesses that they set the rules for.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;Really? You don’t agree that it’s wrong to trash the environment and poison people? If it were your family forced from their homes and suffering with cancer, would you agree then? Would you write a polite letter to RBS and hope that would do did the trick&#8221;</p>
<p>You really didn&#8217;t get the point did you. We don&#8217;t agree the methods you are using. We don&#8217;t agree with climate camp because you are a bunch of hypocrites who are trying to be green gods when you yourselves are part of the problem. So please, like someone else suggested, answer the valid points we have raised instead of replying with cliched BS because that&#8217;s way too easy to do, and does by trick anyone. Well apart from those impressionable individuals in your camp who will grow up and see the light soon enough.</p>
<p>And trust me, I do my art in trying to minimise my impact of living. This in turn reduces demand for gas, oil and coal. What I do not do is cause a lot of damage, cause a lot of unnecessary travel etc like you have so you can have a party which is increasing demand for resources therefore requiring investment in place like the tar pit.</p>
<p>So please get your head out of the clouds and see how it really works, in the real world.  Otherwise if you really cared go lice like the Amish community do, because they are truly unselfish when it comes to the environment.</p>
<p>Again thumbs down.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not at climate camp and I&#8217;ve never been, so I&#8217;m not qualified to comment on whether the people there are &#8220;hypocrites who are trying to be green gods&#8221;. It would seem unlikely though &#8211; mostly I would guess they are just like the rest of us, doing what they can and knowing there is more that they could do, but finding it challenging. My little sister is there, and I know she fits firmly into that category.</p>
<p>And regarding the implication that the camp is itself bad for the environment because they are consuming resources, well, much as you may wish these people didn&#8217;t exist during the rest of the year, actually they do. And they consume resources then too, because they&#8217;re not perfect. Furthermore, I would guess that their footprint whilst at the camp is smaller than their normal footprint (e.g. for my sister who normally lives in a heated building and uses public transport for 2+ hours per day).<br />
And yes, these people travelled there, some of them from quite far away, but most of them probably considered which method of transport would be best, and are regarding it as their summer holiday, and it&#8217;s obviously a lot less damaging than people who travel by air to Europe for multiple long weekends over the summer. </p>
<p>Besides which, as I understand it, climate camp isn&#8217;t a party, it&#8217;s a chance for people who have common interests and goals to meet up, and share ideas and motivate each other. They can attend workshops teaching them about non-direct methods, in order that they can be more effective at these, and the direct methods that they currently feel driven to become unnecessary.</p>

	  <p>&#8220;Why don’t you get a job and leave the RBS staff to get on with theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>They should make this person Prime Minister. Somewhere around 2.5 million people in the UK are unemployed and 600000 public sector lay-offs are projected over the next 5 years. Idiot.</p>
<p>&#8220;We (the public) have heard you, we’ve seen you, and we don’t agree. So please pack up and go, and consider your campaign a complete fail, because if anything, you have come out of this looking worse than the banks.&#8221;</p>

	  <p>&#8220;We live in a democracy, if you have an issue, lobby the Government, and get them to legislate, really not worth lobbying the businesses that they set the rules for&#8221;.<br />
Since when has the government acted strongly enough, quickly enough? Direct action is a result of the democratic system failing. There are plenty of organisations who are lobbying the government but it&#8217;s not working, clearly. So then what? You say you don&#8217;t agree with their methods, but when all else fails the only other option is to take direct action. </p>
<p>Now, all this about hypocrisy; first of all, lobbying the government also requires travel, paper, printing, phones, computers&#8230; Everything we do uses resources so of course this camp has some impact on the environment. It&#8217;s impossible to do anything without having some impact; you just have to minimise it as much as possible, as they have at climate camp by having renewable energy, living in tents (ie with no electricity), vegan food, travelling by public transport as much as possible etc. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a rule in law that says that it&#8217;s acceptable to cause a small crime in order to prevent a larger one, which I think applies here too. People travelling to climate camp, a little damage to property; in the grand scheme of things is so insignificant when you compare it to the massive destruction and human rights abuses caused by RBS and the companies it funds. So, a few frogs have had to be moved, how many frogs do you think are totally wiped out when great swathes of forest are destroyed? It&#8217;s regrettable that staff at RBS feel scared, but there is no physical violence towards them or threats to their lives, not like there is to those people living on the land that fossil fuel companies want to exploit &#8211; they are in real fear for their lives, and that&#8217;s totally justified since many have been killed simply for trying to protect their homes, families and way of life. If I had to choose, I&#8217;d rather be the RBS employee. </p>
<p>Sure, everyone who cares about the environment could go live like the Amish, and whilst that would reduce personal impact on the environment it would do nothing to stop the likes of RBS. You talk about reducing demand, and that&#8217;s a valid point, but sadly it&#8217;s unlikely that enough people will make a big enough change in their lives to make any real impact. You think RBS or the fossil fuel companies have noticed that everyone now uses energy efficient light bulbs?</p>
<p>What you all need to do is go visit the camp or get involved in the movement; then you&#8217;ll be qualified in making a judgement about it. They have created a low impact, peaceful, supportive, creative community in Edinburgh this weekend, one where everyone cooks for each other, eats together, is kind to each other and shares ideas and visions of the future; if you were to experience it you might feel differently. At the moment, you&#8217;ve just fallen for the old stereotypes and media hype. </p>
<p>I get that you don&#8217;t like direct action and I doubt that I&#8217;ll convince you otherwise, but please, just for a minute, try to put yourself in the shoes of the people who are really suffering right now. Imagine your home and whole way of life has been destroyed, that your community is suffering high rates of disease. What would you do? What would you hope others would do? This is an emergency. People in your village are dead. And no-one is listening; the banks, the companies, the government &#8211; no-one cares. Tell me, what would you do? </p>
<p>I know I&#8217;d fight tooth and nail to protect the ones I love and I&#8217;d hope that people who genuinely cared would support me; I&#8217;m quite sure that I wouldn&#8217;t give a damn about a few thousand pounds damage to the multi-billion pound company that caused such devastation to so many. What about you?</p>

	  <p>If you wish to take a moral high ground and campaign against unethical investments by RBS, then you need to do it in a peaceful and lawful way.<br />
The &#8220;Direct Action&#8221; you are planning seems to be nothing more than vandalism and criminal damage verging on terrorism.</p>
<p>Destroying buildings and causing expense to RBS the police and the council (all public money now) means less money available for investment in other causes.<br />
Wanton destruction is the exact opposite of Reduce, Re-use and Recyle.</p>
<p>All you will do is damage the efforts of all real environmentalists who are working in a positive and productive way.</p>
<p>You are not helping the environment. Your anarchistic methods are turning the general public away from green ideals.<br />
Stop using Environmental Concern as a cover anarchism. That will cause far more damage to the planet in the long run.</p>

I do not know where you come from to be here but the law in Scotland is very specific about it.  The Climate Camp web pages give specific advice, try reading it before you speak.</p>

	  <p>Reading this I wonder how many of you critics have actually visited the Climate Camp? I did yesterday with my husband and children and was impressed with the peaceful, friendly and orderly fashion in which the camp was organised. The people whom I spoke to were thoughtful, cared about their planet and wanted to do something to demonstrate that.</p>
<p>All this petty knit-picking over pennies used by campers &#8211; are you missing the point? RBS and some other banks are pumping billions of pounds into unsustainable and unethical projects around the world. It is that that we are trying to stop.</p>
<p>I only wish more people would make the effort to go and visit the camp and hear first hand the many and diverse reasons for protesting. Don&#8217;t be put off by not having been to a camp before &#8211; I hadn&#8217;t and was pleasantly surprised at how welcoming everyone is. If enough people go to these camps coverage will be greater and the government will have to sit up and listen.</p>
<p>The government still have a chance to turn RBS, owned mostly by us, the taxpayer, into a bank more like Triodos or the Co-operative. Why are the politicians so spineless? We do not want more short term profiteering at the expense of the planet and its people.</p>

This is an emergency. People in your village are dead. And no-one is listening; the banks, the companies, the government – no-one cares. Tell me, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then we are back to the point of how you camping on the grounds of RBS going to change anything?  </p>
<p>It wont, because whatever you do against the banks, there will always be someone else there willing to fund these companies.  </p>
<p>We are in a state of transition, where these so called &#8216;evil&#8217; companies are trying to invest in producing cleaner energy &#8211; for you to use.  And without funding, this will end.  Full stop.  Then what? Are you able to produce solar panels, wind farms etc on a scale large enough to sustain the world?  No. So like it or not, you need them.</p>
<p>And this will not happen overnight? Companies are perfectly aware that resources are going to run out and are investing in alternative energies.  Companies are aware that if people do not agree with their methods, customers will leave.  What companies however do not care about, is people like yourselves, getting violent trying to terrorise people into following your idealistic beliefs.</p>
<p>And its a shame, if you really wanted to make an impact, the festival season in Edinburgh would have been a perfect opportunity to set up stall in the royal mile to speak to people and inform them about your issue.  In a peaceful manner, you could have reached a worldwide audience, who would have respected you for your beliefs and method of conveying in. </p>
<p>Instead, because of some of you who are claiming you are being peaceful, have already shown you are unable to be peaceful as there has been arrests made and damage caused.  As for what you are going to get up to tomorrow, who knows, but it would not be surprising if people get hurt. And for these reasons, you have lost of a of support from the general public who now see you, as someone else has mentioned before, borderline terrorists.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a member of the public I regretfully was not made aware that we would be composing a harsh and poorly punctuated dismissal of the Climate Camp. Besides, fuck you. If you think that a few dozen trolls on the climate camp website constitutes the general public: you are sadly mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like how you have to resort to picking on punctuation to make a point.  What a moron.  And no I was not referring to the people on this website as the general public.  I&#8217;m referring to the people who are not attending your little campsite because they do not agree with your methods.  I&#8217;m referring to the thousands and thousands of people who condemn your methods of violence to get a point across. So unfortunately for you, the majority of the public think you are a nuisance and add nothing to society apart from draining resources and causing harm.  </p>
<p>Final point &#8211; all of us use electricity and gas.  So like it or not, you are all in essence funding these &#8216;evil&#8217; companies.  So you are all as guilty as the banks.</p>
<p>Thumbs down.</p>

<p>Honestly, if Climate Camp had remained peaceful throughout their time protesting, I would have.  Unfortunately, they have shown they are not responsible enough to do so.  I am always in favour of doing my bit to help the environment, and would have liked to have gone to see what the camp can offer.  But I do not agree with their methods, which is why I am so strongly opposed. </p>
<p>Like I mentioned before, if they opened a stall on the royal mile, and spoke to people, rather than force themselves upon others, I would have been receptive.  Instead, I see Climate Camp in the same light as any other organisation who have to resort to violence to get their point across.</p>

	  <p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear that a few individuals have caused damage to the building, but they definitely do not represent the hundreds that are there protesting against the taxpayers money being used to fund the destruction of sensitive areas.  Funding from the major banks enabled the Gulf disaster, yet it&#8217;s alright, because it creates jobs?</p>
<p>I think the argument that building wind farms and other forms of renewable energy creates a carbon footprint unacceptable to general society is a spurious one.  Yes, there&#8217;s a carbon footprint in the creation of these power stations, but once they are up and running, that&#8217;s the end of the carbon output, whereas coal/gas stations continually spew out carbon emissions, as well as the environmental damage caused by acquiring the fuel for them.</p>
<p>Yes, Scotlands wealth (and the rest of the UK) is based on the oil and gas industry in the North Sea, a high risk form of energy creation (not only to the environment, but to the platform workers) but there is clear evidence that the UK is in a prime location on the planet to create energy through renewable sources &#8211; we are on the Gulf Stream, we have suitable tidal energy for capture, we&#8217;re a bloody windy country, so why rely on ripping the Earth apart to cook our dinner and heat our homes?</p>
<p>The Tar Sands Issue in Canada is a shocking tale of destruction for profit.  A naturally beautiful landscape is being destroyed, a community is slowly being killed, wildlife is being destroyed, all for a dying fuel source that it costs more to acquire than the energy it will provide.</p>
<p>Imagine &#8211; a drilling company finds oil under Fort William, but the damage it would cause to the local environment means that the town and its locale would need to be destroyed.  The loch would become so polluted that no aquatic life would survive, the people living in the area would end up with various cancers and respiratory conditions and the pollution would affect those living in Glasgow (on top of the pollution already in Glasgow).  Would it still be alright to drill there?  Now, add to that the stripping of the land in order to more cost-effectively grab the fuel, to increase the profit margin.  Would you still be OK about RBS investing into the company doing the damage?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing in Canada.  But apparently it&#8217;s OK because it&#8217;s not in your back yard and its keeping the price of petrol a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And before the cliches kick in, I don&#8217;t drive, I live in a rural area with no train or bus service, so need to walk 3 miles to buy groceries.  I pay taxes, and have a social conscience.</p>

	  <p>climate camp supporter &#8211; you really have got a nerve to assume that you have the right to DICTATE and comit CRIME to get your point over.<br />
Cousland and Ormiston are communities that exist because of coal and what you want to do is to destry those communitioes.  How dare you?</p>

	  <p>&#8220;I know I’d fight tooth and nail to protect the ones I love and I’d hope that people who genuinely cared would support me; I’m quite sure that I wouldn’t give a damn about a few thousand pounds damage to the multi-billion pound company that caused such devastation to so many.&#8221; &#8211; I think that is a call to commit crime&#8230;.. but a wafer thin justification in saying that it is OK if you think it is for a greater cause.<br />
Well its not OK.  Oh, I&#8217;d also fight tooth and nail to protect my community &#8230;.. Mining and fishing community against anyone who thinks they can impose their view on my community.  See, I have the same values as you.  Good, eh?</p>

	  <p>&#8220;Both times were educational, inspirational, peaceful and generally rather beautiful memories. Intelligent, empathetic, and empassioned, fully alive compassionate people and brave young souls doing all they can to ‘improve the situation’ and having a great +ve impact, and working and living together in harmony&#8221;.</p>
<p>WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP &#8211; peaceful is the last thing on your mind when your idiot supporters glue their hands to desks!! Who the f does that??  Answer &#8211; compassionate, brave souls who are intelligent and empathetic.  HA &#8211; utter bollocks.</p>
<p>Do you really think people believe the crap you all spout????</p>
<p>AND AS FOR THE &#8220;CLIMATE CAMP SUPPORTER&#8221; above stating it is acceptable to commit a small crime to prevent a larger one &#8211; what large crime has been/ is being committed here?  I have a sound knowledge of scots law and I cant find one.  Surely if there was it would be investigated.  Or are you of the opinion there is a conspiracy in place and the police are covering up the &#8216;large&#8217; crimes of the banking institutions.<br />
Next you&#8217;ll tell us Elvis is alive, riding Shergar with Lord Lucan by his side and Armstrong never actually landed on the moon!!#</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s reality for you.  Banks are here to stay, they will always be here regardless of whatever childish &#8216;direct action&#8217; you idiots choose to take.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a plan&#8230;.get the police to round you all up in that happy camp and send you to Afghanistan to fight terror abroad.  Surely the Taliban are the real enemy.  I am not aware of RBS employing suicide bombers or planting land mines (although a few secreted in the site you clowns currently occupy would have been a &#8216;blast&#8217;).  Lets see how your direct action affects them!</p>
<p>GO HOME &#8211; YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY AND YOU HAVE FAR LESS SUPPORT THAN YOUR OVER INFLATED EGO&#8217;S CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.</p>

	  <p>tighthead, actually we are not on opposing sides. Yes, I and others, want to see the end of mining for coal etc, but none of us blame the miners themselves and none of us want to see them suffer in any way. It&#8217;s the companies and government at fault. If the government could replace mining jobs with those in renewable energy industries perhaps we could all be happy, the planet included.</p>

<p>Completes my arguement &#8211; IDIOTS.  There is no point debating this further, you lot are losers.  Your actions will change nothing.  It&#8217;s time you started to realise this.

For example, BP have been sued and fined a number of times due to oil spills and pollution caused by their refineries. Not made up, google it.

	  <p>A lot of hot air and uninformed vitriol seems to be generated.  Sounds to me as though some locals noses have been put out of joint which is such a different attitude to community&#8217;s near other climate camp gatherings.  I&#8217;m local to heathrow and was more than happy to put up with some minor inconvenience so that Climate Camp could highlight serious problems and challenges with the Airline industry.</p>
<p>Similarly in Edinburgh try and look beyond whether a window is broken or someone is sleeping in a tent derived from petroleum products &#8211; it&#8217;s the big issues that matter. </p>
<p>Our suicidal rush towards climate catastrophe is being fuelled (pun) by the financial investment decisions of institutions such as RBS.  Oil extraction from tar sands is hugely energy intensive and is destroying large tracts of Canadian wilderness.  Those billions of dollars could be spent developing clean energy technologies.  It takes brave people like the climate campers to raise the issues and change attitudes.  You may regard them as the lunatic fring now but in 20 years time what they are saying will probably (hopefully) be part of establishment wisdom.</p>

<p>Do you actually have any evidence (even a single shred would do but please Google &#8220;evidence&#8221; to find out what that means in a Civila and Criminal Law context) that any bank anywhere in the world received a pitch along the lines of &#8220;hello, I&#8217;d like you to lend me 900 Million quid to fund some illegal activities&#8221;, folllowing which they lent money to be used for that function?</p>

	  <p>After reading all of this, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that you climate campers are nothing but idealists who although have the right idea, are unable to carry out any form of peaceful resolution.  I&#8217;m done with discussing this, and I hope for your sake, and those families in the Canadian areas affected that you do not hurt anyone tomorrow, or damage anymore property, because unfortunately, like it has already, your message is being lost in your actions and this will be remembered for the wrong reasons, and those affected will be forgotten because of you.</p>

	  <p>Based on your own methods, RBS employees and the police should be avoiding your climate camp completely, and going and campaigning outside the headquarters of the Co-Op bank &#8211; who provide financial services to Camp for Climate action.<br />
Members of your camp have committed criminal damage, vandalism etc to RBS buildings and intimidated RBS staff, so should they protest against this by targeting the company that provides banking services to you?<br />
The Co-Op bank must know that violence, vandalism and other criminal acts occur wherever you hold your camps, so it&#8217;s their fault isn’t it?<br />
Should I, as somebody who opposes your methods, then move my accounts and insurance policies from mutual companies to RBS in protest against Co-Ops support of your actions? Should I start shopping in Tesco instead of Scotmid?<br />
No, I realise that your bank is not responsible for your actions.</p>
<p>If you want to make a difference, kick the anarchists and trouble makers out of your camp and target fossil fuel companies, in particular the ones that perform the activities you are campaigning against. Protest and campaign in a peaceful and passive manor. Yes, hand out leaflets, or speak to people on the street to raise awareness.</p>
<p>Any group that is seen to use intimidation and threatening behaviour (as you are seen to do) only lessen public support for their cause.<br />
Before the west took &#8220;Direct Action&#8221; in Afghanistan, most of the UK population would have been in favour of installing a democratic government instead of the taliban, and securing basic equal rights for the population, and moving their economy away from dependency on illegal activities.<br />
How do you think public opinion has changed following the use of &#8220;direct Action&#8221;?</p>
<p>One last point &#8211; If my child was dying of cancer I&#8217;d take them to the hospital and ask for treatment. I wouldn&#8217;t stand outside campaigning for less cancer, threatening the employees, smashing the windows and blocking the entrance. Nor would I go to the bank that funds that hospital.<br />
Then, regardless of the success of the treatment, I would be handing out leaflets and trying raise funds and awareness for that form of cancer.</p>
<p>If you want to make a change to the planet, you need to persuade the public that your ideals are worthy of their support.<br />
At the moment &#8211; you are making backwards progress.</p>

	  <p>There is a lot of talk of &#8220;the Law&#8221; and the breaking of it (or not). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no law that protects the Earth and its people as a whole, which is why we all must take responsibility for our actions and their impact on the long-term well-being of the planet.</p>
<p>The concern with RBS (and other banks) is that they continually overlook this responsibility in favour of short-term profit and growth.</p>
<p>Their investments need to be shifted dramatically away from projects that directly jeopardise our future towards projects that will contribute to a more sustainable world for as many people as possible, including ourselves.</p>
<p>Many of the things that we now take for granted in our society were achieved through civil direct action &#8211; votes for women, for example &#8211; and it is important to maintain a level of perspective on the crimes being perpetrated before dismissing this approach completely.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s also important to appreciate that while all the protesters stand in solidarity with each other in terms of their concerns over climate change, they do not all share the same view on certain types of action and should not therefore be so readily lumped together.</p>

	  <p>Yet the organisers of the camp do not condon any other these actions, and instead ask those to consider how far they are willing to take it? You are all the same, and no different to petty criminals. And I hope the police treat you in the same way.</p>

	  <p>I find it amusing that you claim to be protesting on behalf of the tax payer when the majority of you have most likely yet to pay a penny in tax.

	  <p>What an irresponsible act to cause a potential danger to others in such a reckless way. Sorry, but you don’t rouse a social conscience by actions like that, but you do rouse anger and resentment and the Environmental movement you claim to savour only suffers as a result.<br />
Those with “green” issues all over the country are seen as lawbreakers and destructive criminals because of what you did. Hope you are pleased.</p>

	  <p>pouring oil on the road, causing criminal damage, throwing human shit on the rbs building how the hell do you expecct to win over the public with behaviour like that. you need to weed out the people who are only there to cause trouble, then people may take up your offer of visiting the camp and sitting in on a workshop. Until that time you will not be welcomed anywhere.</p>

	  <p>Any criminality, irrespective of who(m) it is against or for whatever perceived cause it is intended to highlight is wrong.  There is no debate with this.<br />
Age of criminal responsibility is 8.  We know the difference between right and wrong.  Breaking windows of the nurseries, throwing excrement at police and security staff, pouring &#8220;oil &#8211; like&#8221; substances on any roadways and carrying weapons is fundamentally wrong.  </p>
<p>Damaging the environment is also wrong.  </p>
<p>Two wrongs do not make a right (one for cliche) and you lot need to get rid of the anarchists and criminals within your camp before anyone, anywhere, will take you seriously.<br />
Tomorrow you will be gone.  The glaziers will fix the windows, the building will get a clean and all that will remain in the minds of the UK public, and especially the local community here is you came and caused damage to our city and alarmed people trying to earn a wage to live a peaceful, happy life with their loved ones.<br />
Are you so far removed from todays society that you cant see this?<br />
This is your website, how many posts are here in support of your actions?  Less than 3% is the answer, this is echoed nationally and internationally.  </p>
<p>You gain nothing but negative publicity for this.  The talk is not of what the oil companies are doing to the environment but of the damage you all cause in the brief time you have been here.  Not a single person in this city has talked to me about your &#8216;crusade&#8217; and the issues you want to highlight, they only talk of your digusting and degrading tactics vented against innocent members of the public.</p>
<p>You are fortunate only for one thing, that you &#8216;protest&#8217; in the UK because if you carried out these disgraceful actions in any other city in the world the police would have quite rightly adopted a far harder stance.  The police are soft here and adopt too much of a PC, touchy feely approach.  Our legal system is internationally recognised as fundamentally flawed, we let mass murderers simply go home and jail murderers for less than 5 years in some instances to give two of a number of recent examples.<br />
Personally after your actions the other day I would round you all up and jail you for two years apiece.  That would act as a deterent to others that such &#8216;direct action&#8217; will not be tolerated in this country.<br />
Weed out the scum in your camp, protest peacefully as thousands of others do in this city annually and you will gain support and respect for your beliefs.  Who knows, you may even facilitate change.  The banks, oil companies, whoever your &#8216;beef&#8217; is with may actually want to discuss the issues with you!<br />
Until you do this, until you work this out, you will always be lumped together, as one previous post put it, as archarists, the great unwashed, criminals and the whole host of slurs your &#8216;camp&#8217; has been called above.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot to take in but it makes sense.  Work together, find some common ground and stop all the nonesense.  You would not have seen Ghandi throwing tollies (Scottish word for poop) at the Indian authorities to prove a point and you dont need to either.</p>
<p>Respect for any cause has to be earned, not like this.  Not like this.</p>

	  <p>All this fuss because someone broke a window?? Considering what they have done (like many other banks, admittedly) I&#8217;d say RBS got off lightly.</p>
<p>Btw, the Suffragettes broke windows.  In fact window breaking was a major part of their campaign.  Without that, us women would not have got the vote.  </p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s different.  They didn&#8217;t have democracy then, whereas now the government listens to us all&#8230;..</p>
