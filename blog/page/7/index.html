			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				September 08, 2009			</p>

			  <p>So after last minute voting at <a href="/actions/london-2009">Climate Camp in London</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratcliffe-on-Soar_Power_Station">Ratcliffe-on-soar coal power station</a> (owned by that <a href="http://www.e-onf-off.org.uk/home.html">nice company e.on</a>) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOhr6369pZE">was chosen</a>.</p>
<p>As the camp packed down on Wednesday intrepid campers broke past the fences to set up camp inside Ratcliffe warning &lsquo;<a href="http://london.indymedia.org/tumbles/2170">Climate Camp is coming</a>&rsquo; just to show its possible. But lets be honest the vote was only there to take the piss out of voting between 2 bad options (which of course we would never have in reality&hellip;)</p>
<p>Now the important bit starts, getting a huge number of people together and then acting together, all of us, to shut this monster down!</p>
<p>So what can you do now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite all your friends to join this event, tell them about it and get the excited and bring them on the day! Get a group together and plan what you want to do on the day. The first rule of the Great Climate Swoop is tell EVERYBODY about the Great Climate Swoop.</li>
<li>Take this back to any green, justice, community or whatever groups you may be part of and get them to join in.</li>
<li>Come to the planning session to work out what this day is going to look like. It&rsquo;s at the Sumac Centre, Forest Fields, Nottingham on Sept. 12. This is where we get all the crazy ideas together (a penguin bloc, a stilt bloc, picnics, sound systems) get em all down on paper and dream how we are going to move beyond coal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standby for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signing up for travel, we are planning how we are going to get people to the Swoop, we could be putting on coaches from major cities, standby for more info.</li>
<li>A kickass speaker tour going around the country, hopefully stopping at your uni and/or city. If you want to host an event contact: info[@]thegreatclimateswoop.org</li>
<li>New updates on the website (<a href="http://www.thegreatclimateswoop.org">www.thegreatclimateswoop.org</a>) to inspire you and get you all the important info</li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited, and hope you are too, but there is a lot of work to do before October 17th!</p>

			  <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/blog/2009/08/31/flashmob-at-london-city-airport/" rel="bookmark">Flashmob at London City Airport</a>
			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				August 31, 2009			</p>

			  <p>We were 60 activists from Climate Camp, and we were occupying the main entrance to London City Airport alongside activists from the local Fight the Flights campaign group. Looking back,  I was amazed at how quickly an effective action can  be put together.</p>
<p>Just under 24 hours before,  we sat in a tent at the Climate Camp, discussing the shocking approval of corporate-led plans to expand the capacity at London City Airport by 50% against the wishes of the local residents and ignoring its massive impact on the global climate. Soon a flash mob was planned for noon the next day and activists were busy making banners, spreading the word around the neighbourhoods at camp and getting in touch with the local activist group &#8211; Fight the Flights.</p>
<p>The next day at 10:30am we were assembled at the main gates in &lsquo;Stop Airport Expansion&rsquo; t-shirts, ready to make our way to the airport to make our voices heard. A bus and tube ride later and 60 campers and local activists took over the main entrance to the airport with banners reading &lsquo;The rich fly, the poor fry&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stop Airport Expansion&rsquo; singing songs and hearing from those involved in preparing the action.</p>
<p>The London City Airport is one of the most appalling examples of the influence of corporate power and the pursuit if profit, over the needs and wishes of people all over the world. The airport was set up with the sole purpose of providing easy high-class travel for London&rsquo;s business elite in the heart of one of London&rsquo;s poorest areas. It recently gained approval for a 50% increase in flights, a harsh example of the emptiness of Boris&rsquo;s &lsquo;green&rsquo; election promises, and against the wishes of local residents.</p>
<p>As well as damaging the local community the expansion of flights at the airport will also only work to drive up the fastest growing source of emissions in the UK &#8211; aviation. The same corporate interests that continue to push for this expansion are the same interests that will be using the airport this December to fly to Copenhagen to push false solutions such as carbon trading &#8211; to create new corporate profits, preserve business as usual and do nothing to reduce carbon emissions. These interests can&rsquo;t continue to drive our climate change policies and put profit over people, whether it is at City Airport or at Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Today we made sure the airports and the people of London knew the strength of feeling against the airport&rsquo;s plans and heard our message. And by no means is this the end- we will be back!!</p>

			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				August 31, 2009			</p>

			  <p>At 11am today we converged on the Treasury in our cleaning overalls, feather dusters and scrubbing brushes &#8211; to clean up the Treasury&rsquo;s act over their climate change-inducing investments. On this &ldquo;anti-bank&rdquo; holiday we dropped a banner highlighting that &lsquo;Climate Change doesn&rsquo;t  take holidays&rsquo; &#8211; most of the bankers and officials may have had the day off but we were there to press home that time is running out in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The government is ignoring its commitments made under the Climate Act by throwing billions in public money at high street banks such as RBS &#8211; but doing absolutely nothing to challenge the banks&rsquo; investment in environmentally and socially destructive projects such as the tar sands project in Canada. Our affinity group thought it was time to do something to highlight the government&rsquo;s continued inaction on climate change. These investments must stop. Our society must change to become more sustainable- but instead we are witnessing business interests result in madness such as the closure of the Isle of Wight wind turbine blade factory, which the government did nothing to prevent.</p>
<p>After swooping on the Treasury from St James&rsquo; Park we moved onto targets in Whitehall. However, it turns out you can look at the ducks all you like in St. James&rsquo; Park, but forget freedom of speech. Demonstrations and banners are banned (at least according to the police officers on site). The Inland Revenue buildings, the gates of Downing Street and the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change were all treated to a visit from our cleaners &#8211; but we know that unfortunately there&rsquo;s still a lot of dirt to be washed away in the area.</p>
<p>No arrests were made, indeed one police officer even found the time to discuss our action with a young kid passing by &#8211; who after getting one side of the story soon joined in with our spontaneous consensus decision-based meeting on the lawn. It was the first action for many activists in our group; we were delighted that it all managed to come together in such a short time, after four days of training, sustainable living &amp; movement-building at Climate Camp. There&rsquo;ll be many more to come!</p>

			  <p class="intro">This is just a temporary Smooth Over, but it can be the catalyst for radical change!</p>
<p><embed width="568" height="310" src="http://blip.tv/play/gz6Bm95SAg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></p>
<p>The Skipped Smoothover is a project which my friends Cat, Rachel and I dreamt up after a late night dive into a supermarket skip in Wales, where Cat and Rach work at the Centre for Alternative Technology. Cat made a great melon and banana smoothy for our breakfast, and we really wanted to share the goodness of the fruit with as many people as possible. We realised that sharing smoothies with people could be a fantastic way of communicating about the waste issues involved in the methods of food distribution which most of us rely upon &#8211; particularly in the city where there is a very small percentage of the food we eat is produced locally. We decided to bring our smoothies to the Climate Camp, as I knew a wholesale distribution market in the north east of London, who had been very willing to provide their &rsquo;waste&rsquo; fruit for community projects in the past.</p>
<p>We arrived at Blackheath on Saturday with a huge load of fruit, which the whole sellers had fork-lifted into our van for us. We set to cutting apples bananas, mangoes and kiwis and mashing them with potato mashers and squashing them with our hands.. Loads of people got involved, bonding in the squishy gooey production line! We collaborated with Bicycology to build a mechanised smoothie maker which you can see people having fun pedalling on a wee video clip here.</p>
<p>We plan to keep squishing until all the fruit is gone.</p>
<p>This project is all fruity, but it is possible to collect many foods from skips. The skipping culture has brought up interesting moral questions for vegetarians and vegans alike- some choose to eat dairy and meat products which have been thrown away. As a vegetarian, I have eaten some fish and chicken from skips, as I feel disgusted that animals are being reared to be thrown in our bins! It seems more respectful to me, to eat the animal than to put it to landfill.</p>
<p>It was heartbreaking for us to see how much food is thrown away just in one morning at the whole seller&rsquo;s market. This waste of perfectly edible ripe and juicy fruit is the result of overbuying and food standards which stop even slightly wonky produce from being consumed. We are provided excessive choice as consumers. Only the biggest, shiniest, most symmetrical fruit and veg make it to the shelves &#8211; leaving vast amounts of&nbsp; &rsquo;less perfect&rsquo; produce to be thrown away daily, because retailers simply won&rsquo;t purchase it. The current production cycle of agricultural processing is intensive, exhaustive and exploitative. In the UK the food distribution industry accounts for 14% of energy consumption by UK businesses and 7 million tonnes of CO2 per year. The UK food industry&rsquo;s methods are an example of how accepted waste is in the global North.</p>
<p>There are absolute limits to how much waste pollution the earth can absorb, and how much natural resources can be provided. Food reclamation projects like the Skip Smoothover can reduce the amount of valuable food sent to landfill, but we really need to change the system. By altering our buying patterns, we can have encourage more sustainable methods of distribution. It&rsquo;s time to take responsibility! Take what you can from skips, and buy local, seasonal vegetables, so that less produce grown on the other side of the world ends up in our bins!</p>

			  <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/blog/2009/08/29/climate-camp-goes-to-barclays/" rel="bookmark">Climate camp goes to Barclays</a>
			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				August 29, 2009			</p>

			  <p>I hadn&rsquo;t planned to have an afternoon that involved advertising climate camp on the DLR, holding a banner in with a drunken banker, and coming home with a pocket full of free limes. But having stepped outside of the camp gates I got swept up in the enthusiasm of the 100 or so campers on their way to the Barclays Bank headquarters, right in the middle of the canary wharf complex which has become the familiar backdrop of our camp. Barclays invest heavily in coal, the most climate polluting fuel, as well as the arms trade. They were notoriously boycotted for supporting apartheid in South Africa, and those unethical connections continue now.</p>
<p>We took the DLR to canary wharf station (their only response to our invasion was to warn us to stand back from the train), and marched through the bottom of the canary wharf tower, despite the security guard trying to push me back out of the door. Only a few people managed to get into the tower complex itself, and gave out leaflets explaining our Barclays action to people working there. The city, with Canary wharf as its iconic centre, is the hub of the banking industry, whose funding of climate change and carbon trading is gambling with our future.</p>
<p>We left the gates of Barclays covered in messages written on coloured paper, stuck on with pink post-it notes. But not before a good bit of megaphoning at the security guards and any bankers listening, calling them to take of their suits and come and join us.</p>
<p>Then we decided to march around the city, and try to find some bankers in the local gastropubs having a Friday night drink. I was at the front holding our &lsquo;more future, less capitalism&rsquo; banner, when a man in a suit came up next to me and took hold of the end of it. At first I thought he was a camper dressed up as a banker for the event, but soon realised he was a genuine city worker, who had drunkenly joined us. He didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on, and swung between asking us what it was all about, and shouting that he loved us all. As we approached the main access road to Canary wharf, he took the megaphone and danced around in front of the banner (and about 10 big cameras), and addressed the masses.</p>
<p>Our banker left us before we sat down and blocked the road for a while, (letting through the buses). Then back home to the camp, clearing out the free limes being given out by people advertising something on the way home.</p>

			</h2>

			  <p>If only common land really was common and everywhere we looked &#8211; but the mass privatisation of land that took place under the enclosures took care of all that. There is still a lot of common land &#8211; retained through local rebellion, or rejected by the 18th century privatisers because it was poor quality. And you can find it all over England. I loved the freedom of wandering on Blackheath as a teenager, after being caged up in school all day, seeking open space and a way to get out of the house. Now I feel the same need for liberty walking on Port Meadow by the Thames in Oxford.</p>
<p>But there are other kinds of common space that people have claimed as their own through use, like the Royal Parks in London. They might be owned by the antidemocratic figurehead of an anachronistic institution, but they&#8217;re loved and used as free spaces for meeting and playing and being outdoors by people all over the city.</p>
<p>If you defined ownership by use, or love, and not by legal deeds, these parks could be said to belong to the local people.</p>
<p>In Greenwich, right next to Blackheath, the local people are fighting to save their local park from Olympic developers, LOCOG (the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games). They plan to hold the Olympic equestrian sports in the park in 2012, and a rehearsal sporting event in 2011. This will mean closing the park for most of each year, and likely in between; being prepared to cut down ancient trees in the way of the course; riding roughshod (or possibly quite expensively shod) over the historic ground of a UNESCO world heritage site; bulldozing popular local facilities including a children&#8217;s boating pond, a teashop and the bandstand&#8230; you get the picture.</p>
<p>So I was pleased to see that one of the swoop sites began in east London in support of all the communities being affected by the Olympic developers.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to declare an interest here. I loved that boating pond. When my brother and sister and I were new arrivals in the UK aged 8, 9 and 10, culture-shocked and lonely, we would head off through the park and down to the boating pond and practice being English. I bought my first love what seemed like an unforgettably delicious cup of tea in that teashop. We sat and held hands, perched on the bandstand to keep out of the rain.</p>
<p>The people of Greenwich don&#8217;t want or deserve the Olympic invasion, closure and destruction of their park. They need your support: <a href="http://www.nogoe2012.com/">http://www.nogoe2012.com/</a>. This is why so many Greenwich residents support the Climate Camp on Blackheath: we want a future that values our Commons- whether it&rsquo;s the grass our communities use, or the air that we breathe.</p>

<p>It was a particularly early start for around 20 Climate Campers this morning. Bleary eyed but refreshed from our first night on Blackheath we dressed for our day. But whilst wellies and t-shirts might be the usual get-up for a campsite, today called for feather boas, glitzy dresses and tuxedos. We were off back to the European Climate Exchange on Bishopsgate and we were keen to show up this building for the shady casino it is. Meeting at London Bridge we set off by bus to the familiar site of our G20 camp. Jumping off the bus just opposite the Exchange we confidently headed across the road and claimed our space at one of the building&#8217;s entrances.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/climatecasino-3046.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We hung our banner across the grand gates. It proclaimed &#8216;Climate Casino&#8217; in shocking pink. Beneath this we set out our roulette wheel and the games commenced. Cries of &#8216;I&#8217;ll raise you the Amazon&#8217; and &#8217;3 aces for low-lying island states&#8217; abounded. We invited passers-by to &#8216;take a punt on the planet&#8217;.</p>
<p>But why go back to Bishopsgate? Because carbon trading &#8211; the Climate Exchange is the system&#8217;s European stock market &#8211; must be exposed for the dangerous global financial game which it is. Carbon trading has not and will not reduce emissions. It simply makes corporations richer and allows governments to put on a charade that they are doing something about climate change. It is allowing Heathrow&#8217;s third runway to be built and the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station to go ahead, both of which would spell disaster for the climate. Anyone with any common sense can see this is a false solution which must be exposed. It is a dangerous game that weâve been sucked into, and our future depends and getting ourselves out of it.</p>
<p>At around 11am we felt our work had been done and set off to relax and replenish before we headed back to Camp. All in all, we felt this was a great way to kick off the Camp.</p>

			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				August 27, 2009			</p>

			  <p>Dear Resident,</p>
<p>This letter is from the Camp for Climate Action. The camp is setting up on Blackheath from 26 August to 2 September.&nbsp; This letter is just to explain a little about the camp, and to invite you to come along and visit.</p>
<p>The Camp for Climate Action is a diverse bunch of people who want to see more action about climate change.</p>
<p>For the last 3 years&nbsp; we&#8217;ve organised a week long event in the summer to educate each other, demonstrate sustainable living and learn about different ways we can stop and Reverse climate change.&nbsp; 2 years ago you may have heard of us when we were at Heathrow Airport, arguing against the plans for a third runway there.</p>
<p>The camps are family friendly and open to all. There&#8217;s no entrance fee, everyone works on it as volunteers.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very do-it-yourself kind of event and we hope we manage to combine things that are too often kept apart: politics and fun, practice and theory, Education and action&#8230;Please do come along and see for yourself, you are very welcome. </p>
<p>This year we are camping in London because we want to demonstrate and talk about the links between the crisis happening to our climate and the financial crisis and capitalism.&nbsp; We feel that at the root of both are decisions and practices that are made and enacted in centres like the city of London, and that we cannot divorce the problems of environmental damage from the economics of endless growth that is pushed by the City. That is why we have chosen this location, steeped in a history of protest and overlooking the city, to keep us focused on the source of the problem.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re only here for a week, then we pack up,&nbsp; and we hope to cause minimal disruption while we are here.&nbsp; We have an excellent record of clearing up after ourselves; in our first year, the wildlife trust who managed the land next door to us were very complimentary about how we left it.&nbsp; We fully value the open spaces of London, as we&#8217;re sure you do, so we don&#8217;t want to see any damage to the area, or any mess left behind.&nbsp; We will be talking to the council about all matters to do with health, waste, parking, safety issues, etc.</p>
<p>We would like to hold a public meeting on Sunday 30 August, particularly for you, the local<br />
residents, to ask any questions and find out more about the camp.&nbsp; Please ring us on 07529 867185 for more details.</p>
<p>All of the camps in previous years have attracted many members of the local community and we hope this year will be no different.&nbsp; You can come at any time, but if you&#8217;d like someone to show you around then come on one of our guided tours, every evening at 6pm.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>The Camp for Climate Action.</p>
<p>
How to get in touch with us&#8230;.</p>
<p>Phone: 07529 867185</p>
<p>Tours of the camp: 6pm Every Evening from the Welcome Tent</p>
<p>Public Meeting: 3.30 &#8211; 5pm, Saturday 29 August,</p>
<p>Greenwich Community and Arts centre,</p>

			  <p>We teamed up at Kings Cross Station coming from five points across the capital, by train, bicycle and bus. Once we&rsquo;d all checked that we had the Climate Camp legal support phone number written on our arms and our wellies tied firmly to our backpacks, we set off from Aldgate tube station on the Northern Line. As we emerged into the heart of the city, we quickly bumped into a few other familiar faces looking equally anticipatory and wide eyed. With our A-Zs in hand, we made our way to the headquarters of one of the worst climate criminals in the world; mining company Rio Tinto. Despite the notorious and fuel intensive nature of their work, we ended up in a small leafy square and occupied the space with our upbeat spirits, our offbeat music and our unbeatable determination to challenge the root causes of climate change.</p>
<p>As we were getting into the swing of eco-bingo and making bunting, we heard speeches about the ecological injustices committed by Rio Tinto , including poisoning rivers and breaking unions, and also a talk on corrupt backroom deals of carbon business. And then- suddenly- the announcement we had all&nbsp; been waiting for came! We were to head with all possible speed to London Bridge Station. We set off as a crowd of sixty complete with legal observers, musicians and of course, journalists.</p>
<p>We sang on the platform and&nbsp; helped each other with our bags as we jostled for space on the Tube. And as we lined up on the escalators on the other side- the message went up that we were taking the overland train to Blackheath. As we finally approached the campsite, we could see the banner strung tightly between the tripods, Canary Wharf emerging from the mists beyond the heath. This is Common Land, the place where Wat Tyler sparked rebellion in 1381, struggling against bad government and unfair taxes.</p>
<p>And now this common is the site off a new struggle. We are reclaiming our right to the commons. False solutions like carbon trading are no more than a way of buying, selling and polluting something that belongs to us all. In targeting the banks, corporations and politicians in the City, w stand side by side with those who are fighting to keep the Commons alive around the world, indigenous rights campaigners, the growing movement for climate justice and ordinary people everywhere who are realising that we all need to take action to halt catastrophic climate change.</p>
<p>We came. We Swooped. We are camping.</p>

			</h2>

			<p class="meta">
				August 25, 2009			</p>

			  <p class="intro">&#8216;Twas the night before swooping, on the eve of events<br />
All the campers were stirring, and packing their tents&#8230;</p>
<h3>What I&#8217;m bringing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tent</li>
<li>Wind-up torch</li>
<li>Sleeping bag</li>
<li>Vegan snacks (don&#8217;t worry, a week&#8217;s worth of food will be provided!)</li>
<li>London A to Z</li>
<li>Sense of solidarity</li>
<li>Wellies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Baggage we don&#8217;t need:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/get-involved/get-educated/carbon-trading">Carbon trading</a></li>
<li>War criminals telling us what to do</li>
<li>Global North bigotry</li>
<li>Vestas bosses</li>
</ul>
<p>While we sort out our stuff and hang on our phones for last minute updates, this might be a good moment to take our collective breath and remember why we&#8217;re doing all of this.</p>
<p>Right now the world seems even more chaotic than my half-packed rucksack, what with the economy being predicted to swing first&nbsp;<a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/support_services/article6807564.ece" target="_blank">one way</a>, and then the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/6080523/Nouriel-Roubini-warns-threat-of-double-dip-recession-is-rising.html" target="_blank">other</a> and extreme weather patterns threading their way across Europe.&nbsp;But we need to stop listening to the&nbsp;oscillating&nbsp;opinions of the &#8216;business community&#8217;, and instead lend an ear to the voices of hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world, whose livelihoods &amp; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/aug/24/climate-camp-canada-oil-tar-sands" target="_blank">communities&nbsp;are being threatened</a> by our fuel-guzzling nations. Yesterday, representatives from African nations made demands for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8217449.stm" target="_blank">financial compensation</a>&nbsp;for the damage done to their land by the industry-heavy global North.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s just look at some of the facts about how our &#8216;leaders&#8217; are supposedly tackling the climate crisis right now:</p>
<p>In the run up to the&nbsp;<a href="/actions/copenhagen">United Nations conference on climate change in Copenhagen</a> this December (the infamous COP15),&nbsp; there are hopes for promises of emissions cuts of as much as 80% by 2050. But the market systems concocted to achieve this are collapsing like a tent without tent-pegs.</p>
<p>Business opportunities and bankers&#8217; initiatives, seen as a method of &#8216;going green&#8217;, are being given the thumbs up by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6061978/Tony-Blair-Copenhagen-climate-summit-must-not-be-about-percentages.html" target="_blank">war criminals</a>, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that the world&#8217;s largest companies are <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/biggest-global-companies-39-yrs-behind-ipcc-recommendations/71560/on" target="_blank">39 years behind</a> in achieving the necessary emission reductions.&nbsp;No wonder: even carbon trading is being caught up in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE57J3BC20090820" target="_blank">back-room deals and corruption</a> &#8211; as if it weren&#8217;t enough of a crazy and unjust idea already!</p>
<p>To make radical reductions in carbon emissions, we need to take radical action. The <a href="http://savevestas.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/camp-for-climate-action-this-week-why-working-class-people-should-get-involved/" target="_blank">Isle of Wight workers</a> show how communities &nbsp;in the UK can fight for a just transition to clean energy, that the effects of climate change are being felt by people around the world everyday, and that it&#8217;s up to all of us to do something about it. So make sure you stuff a feeling that the world can change and a sense of solidarity into your rucksack as well.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to try and build another world. We&#8217;re geared up to <a href="http://libcom.org/library/participatory-society-or-libertarian-communism" target="_blank">discuss alternatives</a>, to resist&nbsp;<a href="http://london.indymedia.org/articles/1920" target="_blank">climate criminals</a>, and to create a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40295422@N06/" target="_blank">vision of a sustainable world.</a>&nbsp;We&#8217;re camping for Climate Action, one tent at a time.</p>
