				August 24, 2009			</p>

			  <p class="intro">Last Thursday, the Camp for Climate Action Police Liaison Team spoke at a &quot;briefing afternoon&quot;, at the Metropolitan Police&#8217;s Training Centre in Gravesend. Why did they do this, and what on Earth could they possibly say to the police? Simon Stanley was at the scene&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be frank. It&#8217;s a weird task to take on. One day you&#8217;re doing your best to avoid the cops as you try to invade a <a href="/actions/climate-swoop-2009">power station</a> / <a href="/actions/heathrow-2007">airport</a> / <a href="http://leaveitintheground.org.uk/?p=212">corporate HQ</a>. The next day, you choose to sit down in a room full of police. Why?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just an idle question &ndash; many people within the climate movement have suffered terrible treatment at the hands of the police, and are understandably concerned about meetings between cops and Campers. Meanwhile, the recent rapid pace of events has made it hard to keep track of what meetings are going on with the police, and why. This article is an attempt to clear things up a bit, to explain why last week&#8217;s meeting happened, and what we think it achieved.</p>
<p>The main part of the Police Liaison Team&#8217;s remit is to gather information first-hand about likely police tactics, strategy, personnel and attitude. However, the group has another important role as well: to give the Camp credibility in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p>Those of us who&#8217;ve had a lot of dealings with the police <a href="/blog/2009/08/20/open-letter-to-the-met">know how little we can trust them</a>, but many of the public haven&#8217;t had that experience. If we refuse to talk to the police, then a lot of people will (rightly or wrongly) think we&#8217;re being unreasonable and so be less likely to get involved with the Camp.</p>
<p>Meeting with the cops also gives the Climate Camp a &quot;human face&quot; and might make some officers be a tiny bit less brutal towards us (we have no definite proof of this, though). And of course, each meeting brings us one step closer to the day when the underpaid officers at the Camp gates suddenly decide to lay down their truncheons, take off their riot gear, stick two fingers up at Gold Command and join us in building a beautiful eco-anarchist utopia. Possibly.</p>
<p>The Police Liaison volunteers aren&#8217;t &quot;representatives&quot; of the Camp &ndash; they don&#8217;t negotiate with the police, make any concessions to them, or give them any information that they wouldn&#8217;t have found out anyway. In previous years, this has been a slightly frustrating, often uncomfortable, but nonetheless important job.</p>
<p>This year, however, things have gone a bit weird.</p>
<p>Thanks to the police getting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dVmate9RGY">caught in the act at the G20 protests</a>, and the series of vaguely critical official reports that followed, there has been unprecedented media interest in any meetings between the Camp and the police. The cops are on the back foot and are desperately trying to repair their image, and so rather than fobbing us off until the last minute, they are falling over themselves to drag us into meetings. It&#8217;s pretty bizarre stuff &ndash; and it&#8217;s not without its dangers.</p>
<p>From their quotes in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/aug/18/met-police-climate-camp-twitter">this recent Guardian article</a>, it seems the cops are keen to say &quot;look, we&#8217;re even having meetings with the protesters, aren&#8217;t we nice!&quot;. There&#8217;s a real risk that by agreeing to these meetings, we might be unintentionally helping out the police with their propaganda &ndash; which is why we worked together with the Camp&#8217;s media team on an <a href="/blog/2009/08/20/open-letter-to-the-met">Open Letter To The Met</a> to make the Camp&#8217;s position <strong>very</strong> clear. While in the short term the idea that the police are going to be all cuddly this time round may help to get more people to the <a href="/actions/london-2009">London Camp</a>, in the long term it could be very dangerous. If the public and the media decide the police have mended their ways, then their interest will soon wander, leaving the cops free to get the batons out again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we aren&#8217;t the only ones being harassed by the police. That&#8217;s why the <a href="/get-involved/working-groups/legal">Camp&#8217;s Legal Team</a> have been building connections with other activist groups including <a href="http://www.fitwatch.blogspot.com/">Fitwatch</a> and <a href="http://www.ldmg.org.uk/">London Defence and Monitoring</a>, as well as organisations representing migrant communities, the <a href="http://www.campacc.org.uk/">Campaign Against Criminalising Communities</a>, the <a href="http://muslimprisonersupport.com/">Muslim prisoner support group</a> and the <a href="http://www.nmp.org.uk/">Newham Monitoring Project</a>. Plans are afoot to get funding for a new umbrella group to keep monitoring the police and holding them to account &ndash; wherever and whenever they might operate.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget: the police&#8217;s job is to enforce laws which defend the status quo, protect the wealthy and the powerful, and stand in the way of social change. This has been their role throughout history, and not just within the UK. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re trying to build a movement to create massive social change by directly confronting the Government and wealthy, powerful, polluting corporations. This doesn&#8217;t make it very likely that the police are ever going to be our friends.</p>
<p>However, one thing that <strong>can</strong> change is the tactics available to the cops &ndash; the exact level of violence and intimidation that they&#8217;re allowed to get away with. It would be lovely to believe that we might influence this just by having meetings with the police. Sadly, experience shows that the only thing that really works is forcing them to change by exposing their tactics to the world. It&#8217;s annoying that we have to do this &ndash; we&#8217;d much rather spend the time on climate action &ndash; but if we don&#8217;t, then things will only get worse.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to reassure the rest of the climate action movement that the Police Liaison team fully understand all of this, and that we are also actively challenging attempts by the police (and the media) to separate our movement into &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; protesters. We&#8217;ve done our best to explain this at <a href="/get-involved/national-gatherings">gatherings</a> and on email lists, and we&#8217;re sorry if it hasn&#8217;t been totally clear! If you have any concerns or suggestions about the work we&#8217;re doing, please get in touch with us &ndash; or better yet, come and join the Police Liaison team and get involved yourself.</p>
<p>So it was with all this in mind that I stood up in front of a crowd of seventy police officers on Thursday afternoon, and explained to them why the Climate Camp was happening, how non-hierarchical decision-making works, and what this year&#8217;s Camp will probably look like. I then described what it was like to be charged by a line of riot cops for no discernible reason, to watch your friends being beaten over the head and arrested on meaningless charges, to see people in front of you being pepper-sprayed in the face, and to know you have to stand your ground anyway with your hands in the air because the alternative is to let a beautiful Camp be trampled under their steel-toecapped boots. They listened, in silence. It was one of the weirdest things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. Whether or not it will make any difference, I really couldn&#8217;t say; but it felt oddly liberating all the same.</p>
<p>Next, we got to hear the police&#8217;s pre-Camp strategy briefings first-hand. Then they took us on a tour of the place where they train riot police, a kind of &ldquo;Riotland&rdquo; theme park with a life-sized fake Council estate, tube station and sports stadium&#8230;but no, that was far too strange to have really happened. It must have been a bizarre dream.</p>

			  <p><em>This is a re-post, which was <a href="http://www.ameliasmagazine.com/amelias_blog/2009/08/climate_camp_cymru_ffosyfran_m.php">originally published</a> over at <a href="http://www.ameliasmagazine.com/">Amelia&#8217;s Magazine</a>.</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live just 37 metres from the gaping chasm of an opencast coal mine. Seems unimaginable eh? Surely it&#8217;s not possible? Who would choose to live this way?</p>
<p>Well, noone as it goes. But for some there is no choice, as shown in the aerial view above. <a href="http://www.millerargent.co.uk/client_files/default/1906081_222a_for_james_heather_medium.jpg">The people of </a><a href="http://www.merthyr.gov.uk/home/default.htm?language=English">Merthyr Tydfil</a> have no choice. Despite mass complaints from locals and a <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/saying-no-to-the-new-coal-age20071206">large scale direct action featuring polar bears and George Monbiot</a> (a Welsh resident) it was decreed by politicians far away that coal would once again be mined from these hills. Last year the hilariously named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffos-y-fran">&#8216;Ffos-y-fran Land Reclamation&#8217;</a> scheme began in earnest.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0054.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Miller Argent is the company (funded by BT pension funds) responsible for scooping out the tops of these hills and delivering the low grade coal to the old coal fired power station at <a href="http://www.yourlocalweb.co.uk/images/pictures/08/97/aberthaw-power-station-87904.jpg">Aberthaw,</a> which is now being run with 40% Ffos-y-fran coal. Tellingly, the environment section of the <a href="http://www.millerargent.co.uk/">Miller Argent Ffos-y-fran website</a> is empty; &#8220;<a href="http://www.millerargent.co.uk/environment/">under construction</a>&#8221; whilst a photo of the <a href="http://www.millerargent.co.uk/people/">mining &#8216;team&#8217;</a> lined up in front of their shiny new yellow diggers is given pride of place.</p>
<p>Of course there is plenty of space for company propaganda too, giving highly spurious reasons for destroying the landscape in the name of &#8216;reclamation&#8217;. But this was never &#8216;derelict&#8217; land as Miller-Argent would have you believe &#8211; it was <a href="http://www.amyscaife.co.uk/MerthyrTydfil/index.html">common land used widely by locals</a>. As happens across the world, common or marginal land is seen as unimportant when in fact it often serves an important purpose to the populations close by. The truth of the matter is that this area has been <a href="http://www.ggat.org.uk/news/archive/news_archive_2008.html">prodded and mangled for its coal</a> since it was first discovered &#8211; the hills are riddled with old mine workings. These were abandoned as economically redundant until new technology appeared on the scene and new government policies made it financially viable to crash into the landscape once more, just as it was recovering from centuries of destruction.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1434.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>As I climbed the hill towards Ffos-y-fran I cursed the wording on the website &#8211; &#8220;just 15 minutes walk from the station&#8221; it trumpeted. There were an awful lot of taxis passing me as I struggled towards a sign chalked enigmatically on the wall. &#8220;Getting There&#8221; it said. It lied. After another interminable uphill climb past rows of terraced houses I reached a roundabout. Not long after a huge neon yellow sign reading Clean Coal: Dirty Joke strung along the hedge revealed the entrance of <a href="http://climatecampcymru.org/">Climate Camp Cymru</a>. A van of <a href="http://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heddlu">Heddlu</a> (Welsh for police) was parked idly on the other side of the road, but otherwise all was tranquil.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1436.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I passed the familiar sight of the welcome tent and some solar panels atop a van, and came across someone I knew almost immediately, who offered me a tasty plate of vegan nosh.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1307.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0112.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0131.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0304.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Perusing the beautiful and conclusive bilingual handbook about what workshops to do in which tent or &#8220;gwagle&#8221; I was massively cheered to see that <a href="http://climatecampcymru.org/">Climate Camp Cymru</a> had really taken <a href="http://www.miaovergaard.com/">Mia Overgaard</a>&#8216;s beautiful designs for the <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/?q=node/468">Climate Camp in Londo</a>n to heart (adapting the poster by adding some sheep and daffodils), and had used it on their handbook &#8211; sadly this hasn&#8217;t happened for the <a href="http://twitter.com/Climatecampldn">Climate Camp in London</a> next week which, rather confusingly, seems to be using designs from multiple people. The perils of design by consensus&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/CCCymru%20Mia.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once my tent was up I went on a tour of the site with my camera and found myself chatting to a pair of old biddies in a car at the back gate. They were keen to support us but felt unable to physically join us &#8211; I learnt that their parents were colliers and they thought they&#8217;d seen the last of the industry when it closed down last century.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0070.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>With some coyness they told me how they&#8217;d taken their placards into the council chambers when it was announced the &#8216;reclamation&#8217; was reopening (dontcha just love the use of the word &#8216;reclamation&#8217; &#8211; sounds like something to do with Shakespeare or have I got my history all muddled?!) I thought that was pretty impressive myself and told them as much.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0864.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>After dinner there was a plenary with a group of activists talking about community campaigns and how best to work with local residents. Activists from <a href="http://www.planestupid.com/">Plane Stupid,</a> <a href="http://www.corribsos.com/">Rossport in Ireland</a>, <a href="http://www.lanarkgazette.co.uk/news/Mainshill-hosts-first-Scottish-Climate.5527623.jp">Mainshill in Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.smashedo.org.uk/">Smash Edo in Brighton</a> were joined by two members of RAF, or <a href="http://www.stopffosyfran.co.uk/">Residents Against Ffos-y-Fran</a>. It was really thrilling to hear how similar everyone&#8217;s stories were and how possible it was to learn and grow stronger by offering solidarity with each other. By the end the tent was whooping and a plan had been hatched to go for a walk into the mine the next day.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0901.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1338.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was to be a hot topic of discussion at the neighbourhood and site wide meetings the next morning. Somehow, in a matter of hours, the word was put out amongst residents in town and by lunchtime we&#8217;d gathered our walkers. Joining us were members of the <a href="http://www.clownarmy.org/about/about.html">Rebel Clown Army</a>, out of retirement after their costumes were confiscated at Kingsnorth last year, and the <a href="http://www.mischiefmakers.org.uk/gallery.html">penguins from Climate Caravan of 2008</a> &#8211; expert in the art of the waddle.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0342.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1472.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0439.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We climbed over the gate with no problems but by the time we&#8217;d got to the roundabout a few confused police were attempting to curtail our progress. However, once the penguins had siddled around there was no stopping everyone else. We continued our ramble up towards the heart of the mine as locals slowed in their cars and their kids joined us. The clowns gamboled playfully around the police who hadn&#8217;t a clue what to do with these strange creatures, expert in the art of the carefully timed wind-up.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0455.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0686.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0720.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And then we got to the intersection where the road continues through the centre of the great scar that is the mine. The police weren&#8217;t having it, even though it is a public highway, with a Section 12 (emergency restraint) being cited to stop us advancing any further. For our own safety mind you.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0474.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some people stayed on the road but the majority of walkers just decided to follow the penguins up onto the hill on the other side. I passed a large van of aggressive sounding police dogs, all the better to chase trespassers across mines huge opencast mines I hear.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0481.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0513.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Despite the deployment of two large police horses as well as the dogs we failed to provide the running targets the police might have liked after three tense and boring days of sitting in their vans. Instead we wandered around the hilltop with the clowns and the penguins, taking in the full enormity of the mine and being given a potted history by the locals.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0545.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0625.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>As the drizzle moved back in again we descended the hill to head home for tea and discovered that one man had been arrested shortly after being bitten by a police dog for trying to break through the lines on the road. He was taken into custody and held for over forty hours during which he successfully contested bail conditions which meant he could not attend <a href="http://twitter.com/climatecamp">Climate Camp</a> in London next week.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0641.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The police were notabley absent on the walk back to camp, contrary to a statement released to the press stating that they escorted us home. I guess we didn&#8217;t provide the excitement they might have liked at the top of the hill and they lost interest. We even passed a few cheeky scoundrels</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-0712.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We set out to police this event, in a manner which reflected the needs of the protestors to lawfully protest&#8230; We are pleased that we achieved this aim and were able to avoid scenes in trend at other protests in the UK,&#8221; said South Wales police in a statement released yesterday. I had no idea we were &#8216;on trend&#8217; as they like to say in the fashion world!</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1519.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Before dinner we went on a mission to buy some beer from the local store (cider of all cheap varieties is a must in this town if the shelves are to be believed) and a local lady kindly gave us a lift back up the hill &#8211; on the way she told of how she&#8217;s just had to install new windows because the dust has got so bad between the panes of glass. It&#8217;s a common refrain with locals, who suffer from all kinds of complaints due to the dust and noise coming from the mine, which, unbelievably, is open from 7am to 11pm six days a week. This in a town which already has the second highest incidence of chest complaints in Britain. But that&#8217;s okay! Because <a href="http://coalintheuk.org/tag/miller-argent/">Miller-Argent</a> is regulating pollution emissions. Well, self-regulating if you&#8217;re being picky. Self-regulating and under no obligation to share the information if you&#8217;re being particularly pushy. Understandably the locals aren&#8217;t exactly happy with this situation.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1416.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The folks from <a href="http://www.bicycology.org.uk/">Bicycology</a> had a small bike generator with which to power films, so I spent much of that night glued to the screen, which showed, amongst other things, a film about <a href="http://baldwinbrothers.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/mountaintop-removal520.jpg">mountain top removal for coal in Virginia in the USA</a>. The mountains</p>
<p><img src="/blog_images/Climate-Camp-Cymru-Aug-2009-1468.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In Virginia there have been huge and devastating floods in the valleys below the mined areas, which have lost their topsoil and are no longer able to soak up rainfall. The companies responsible have of course abdicated all responsibility but I remember Geography GCSE! Back then I learnt that if you screw with the ability of the earth to soak up water there will be consequences. Could the same thing happen in the steep valley of Merthyr Tydfil? It seems highly likely if opencast mining continues.</p>
<p>On Sunday I went on a workshop to learn more about plants in the area, and was delighted to discover that the yellow berries packed tightly onto the branches of <a href="http://floraleads.com/seabuckthorn/">Sea Buckthorn</a> are edible; tiny and tangy they are the richest source of vitamin sea after rosehips. I&#8217;ve brought a bag home to soak in some vodka &#8211; and wouldn&#8217;t you know it I discovered that the berries are used in a <a href="http://www.danish-schnapps-recipes.com/sea-buckthorn.html ">favourite Danish schnapps recipe</a>.</p>

<p>After lunch the final plenary looked at how the <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/?q=node/468">Climate Camp</a> movement can go ahead in Wales and how relations with Merthyr Tydfil will continue going forward. There was a real feel of excitement in the air as it was decided that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40295422@N06/">Climate Camp Cymru</a> would have it&#8217;s first official national gathering within the next six weeks and many people seemed more determined than ever to make it down to the <a href="/actions/london-2009">Climate Camp in London</a> next week. Tat down, (clear up of the camp) continued apace afterwards and I left feeling extremely happy that I&#8217;d made the effort to travel up to Wales and take part in the camp.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now getting even more excited about the week long <a href="/actions/london-2009">Climate Camp in London</a> which starts next Wednesday 26th August with a <a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/actions/london-2009/swoop">city-wide &#8220;swoop&#8221;</a> on our yet-to-be-revealed site. If you care about the planet you live upon (and you should, it&#8217;s the only one we&#8217;ve got!) come and join us this year. There will be hundreds of workshops on sustainability, direct action and how the financial system is affecting our environment &#8211; not to mention a diverse program of evening entertainments. We&#8217;ll be camping over the Bank Holiday weekend so why not come visit? It could be the life-changing experience it was for me at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/climatecamp2007/">Heathrow in 2007</a>.</p>
<p>Until then&#8230;</p>

			  <p><embed width="568" height="335" src="http://blip.tv/play/hJsLgZqoNgA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></p>
<p>Open Letter <span class="caps">FAO</span> Chief Superintendent Ian Thomas,<br />
New Scotland Yard<br />
London SW1H 0BG</p>
<p>Dear Chief Superintendent Thomas,</p>
<p>On August 17th, you wrote to the Camp for Climate Action, requesting further information on the location of <a href="/actions/london-2009">our next Camp</a>, which will take place from August 27th to September 2nd, somewhere in the London area. You say that you require this information in order to help with &ldquo;community liaison&rdquo;, to ensure the Camp is a &ldquo;safe and healthy&rdquo; event, and to help you put a &ldquo;pre-planned and proportionate policing operation&rdquo; in place. We are writing this open letter in order to alleviate your concerns, and to make our position clear both to yourself and to the public.</p>
<p>Community liaison has been a vital part of every Climate Camp. At <a href="/actions/drax-2006">Drax in 2006</a>, <a href="/actions/heathrow-2007">Heathrow in 2007</a> and <a href="/actions/kingsnorth-2008">Kingsnorth in 2008</a>, we put a lot of time and effort into spending time with local residents and allaying people&rsquo;s concerns, and this year will be no different. We have a good track record of building community support for the Camp and for climate change campaigning, we&rsquo;ve already been in touch with local Councils across London, and our friendly outreach volunteers will be chatting to the locals from the moment we arrive on site. We plan to be excellent neighbours for as long as we&rsquo;re there, we&rsquo;ll be open and welcoming to any local residents with questions or concerns, and we&rsquo;ll leave the site spotless when it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>As regards health and safety &ndash; thanks for your concern, but again we&rsquo;ve got it under control. As with <a href="/actions/past">previous Camps</a>, we&rsquo;ll have great food, water, compost toilets, a team of medics, a wellbeing space, excellent on-site communication, emergency vehicle access, and a family space. We also have a &ldquo;Safer Spaces&rdquo; policy and a &ldquo;Tranquillity Team&rdquo; to help keep the site free from oppressive behaviour or aggro. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent time at past Camps will tell you how friendly and safe the atmosphere is &ndash; better than most mainstream festivals.</p>
<p>Of course, there is one unfortunate exception to all of this. While most visitors to previous Camps have had an inspiring and positive experience, some of us have had to suffer <a href="/get-involved/working-groups/legal/g20_report.pdf">violence</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dVmate9RGY">intimidation</a>, <a href="/get-involved/working-groups/legal/Kingsnorth_Policing_Report.pdf">theft</a>, <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1869048">sleep deprivation</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_video_blog?user=uklegalobserver">harassment</a>, thanks to past examples of &ldquo;pre-planned and proportionate policing operations&rdquo;. Local communities have been disrupted by police road closures and indiscriminate stops-and-searches. Members of the public have been attacked with batons or arrested on trumped-up charges simply for standing on the perimeter of a campsite (nearly all of them have now been acquitted or had their charges dropped). Judging from past experience, the best thing the police could do to ensure the health and safety of the public at Climate Camp 2009 would be to stay as far away from it as possible.</p>
<p>Bearing all of this in mind, I hope that you, and the public, understand why we don&rsquo;t feel able to reveal the precise location of the Camp at this time. Every other aspect of the Camp has been organised in an open, accountable and democratic way, via <a href="/get-involved/gatherings">monthly public meetings</a>. The only secret is the location. There&rsquo;s a simple reason for this: I&rsquo;m afraid we just don&rsquo;t trust the police. Why? Because it seems as though every time we have a protest, the police turn up and start hitting people. Look what happened at <a href="/actions/g20-2009">the G20</a>. That&rsquo;s not really a very good way to win people over.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;ve started using friendlier language and talking about &ldquo;lighter-touch&rdquo; policing, do you really think we&rsquo;re suddenly going to believe you&rsquo;re our friends? Just a few weeks back the <a href="http://www.big-green-gathering.com/">Big Green Gathering</a> was shut down by the police on spurious grounds, for &ldquo;political&rdquo; reasons. If the police are really trying to build up trust within the climate action movement, then that&rsquo;s a funny way to go about it.</p>
<p>The precise location of the Camp for Climate Action 2009 will be announced via mass text as part of the exciting August 26th &ldquo;<a href="/actions/london-2009/swoop">Swoop</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll just have to sign up on <a href="/">our website</a>, and wait for the updates just like everybody else!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>The Camp for Climate Action Media Team</p>

				August 18, 2009			</p>

			  <p>It is done! The last month has been a blur of late nights, black coffee and square eyes for me, as we in the website group have been working fervently to put this new site together.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re feeling really pleased with how it has turned out. We now have a great platform on which we are building a truly useful resource for climate campers past, present, and – most importantly of all &#8211; future!</p>
<p>But while the website is finally launched, with just a week to go until the London camp, this is really only the beginning. There&#8217;s going to be loads to do keeping it up-to-date, and we&#8217;d be delighted if new people wanted to get involved with the group to help out – either on a one-off basis or longer term.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a blog post! &#8211; We&#8217;d love to hear personal accounts of 	actions, reports from other camps, political commentary, etc</li>
<li>Editing photos and content</li>
<li>“Curating” existing content – making sure it is up-to-date, 	well formatted and relevant</li>
<li>Checking the website email account</li>
</ul>
<p>To get involved, or to give us your thoughts and (hopefully not) bug reports, email website[@]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p>Finally, whilst we&#8217;ve working hard to try and ensure the changeover is as smooth as possible, please do bear with us if we experience any teething difficulties.</p>
<p>See you at camp!</p>
