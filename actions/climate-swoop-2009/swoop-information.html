  <h1>What to bring</h1>
  
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things that you will need to organise for the swoop. Ideally this could be sorted out between you in your affinity groups or as a neighbourhood to help share the load.</p>
<p><a href="/actions/climate-swoop-2009/maps"><strong>Download printable maps of ratcliffe here.</strong></a></p>
<h2>Absolute Essentials!</h2>
<p>Things we strongly suggest everyone should bring.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food and water</strong>. This is absolutely the most important thing! Remember you need to bring enough to last you for 2 days (and maybe a little to share with your new found swoopers). High energy stuff like Flapjacks, Houmus, Sugary foods or Kendel Mint Cake are great for keeping you going through a long blockade. You should bring at least 2 litres of water with you as there won&rsquo;t be any taps nearby!</li>
<li><strong>All your warm clothes (and then some!)</strong>. We&rsquo;ll stay overnight, and it&rsquo;s going to get really cold, especially without the heat from the coal fires next door! Hat, Gloves, Coat andthick socks are essentials &hellip; plus with this being October in England, you may well need to think about Waterproofs too.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeping bag</strong>. It&rsquo;s a good idea to also bring a roll-mat and some tarp (e.g. these blue plastic sheets from garden shop) along with some lines to hang the tarp up with. This would be perfect to sort out with your friends and other people in your neighbourhood as besides spreading the load being carried, getting as many people under a tarp as possible means a warmer night for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Sturdy boots</strong>. Take a look at the arial photographs and you&rsquo;ll see that flip-flops or high heels are going to make for a pretty rough time on your feet. Keep your feet happy and you&rsquo;ll have even more energy to put into a successful action!</li>
<li><strong><a href="/actions/climate-swoop-2009/Swoop2009Bustcard.pdf">Bustcard</a></strong>. Download this absolute must have item, also <a title="A4Swoop2009BustCard" href="/actions/climate-swoop-2009/A4Swoop2009BustCard.pdf">available as an A4</a>. Make sure everyone in your group has a copy and try to memorise the number of a good solicitor just in case (details will be on the card. It&rsquo;s highly recommended to writethis number on your arm in something that won&rsquo;t easily wash off. Even if you&rsquo;re not planning to get arrested, it&rsquo;s still worth havin this just in case (see seizure of crayons, board games etc at Kingsnorth last year for evidence of weird policing)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
<p>We would suggest to bring these things for your  group to share</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Torch</strong>.  There&rsquo;s no street lighting nearby and if it&rsquo;s cloudy it&rsquo;ll be  pitch black.  Don&rsquo;t forget to switch it of if you&rsquo;re trying not to be seen&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Map and compass</strong>.  Knowing the layout of the area well before you arrive is a great  idea, and  your action may well depend on you knowing exactly where you are  at any  time. In this situation, stopping and asking a policeman for  directions  might not be the best idea :-) So check out (the website with  the map) and  learn how to use a compass.</li>
<li><strong>Tent</strong>.  Not only great for sleeping in, it presents both a handy  billboard to get  your message across along with a cunning obstacle for road  traffic if you  plan to stay put for a while! Pop up ones may be best for this but  planning  this as an affinity group or neighbourhood and spreading the load is  ideal.  Remember though that there is no campsite planned for his action  and so  you  will have to bear this in mind when deciding whether or not to  pack the  extra weight.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Phone</strong>.  A pay as you go mobile with a camera is ideal. If you&rsquo;re using  your own  phone, remember to back up your contact list and then delete it  from your  phone just in case before arriving. It&rsquo;s pretty important to get  a new sim  card to use for this action and make sure the other members of your  affinity  group have the number. If you&rsquo;re taking pictures of your action,  remember  to  ask before shooting and don&rsquo;t incriminate anyone. Reception  probably won&rsquo;t  be too great so don&rsquo;t rely on it too much but if your phone has an  internet  browser you can go to<a href="http://mob.notts.indymedia.org.uk"> mob.notts.indymedia.org.uk</a>&nbsp; and upload your  photo&rsquo;s/videos/text straight to the Nottinghamshire Indymedia  website to  tell the world about your exciting action.</li>
<li><strong>Action Specific Stuff</strong>.  Between your group you may have already decided how you are  going to go  about your action against Ratcliffe-on-soar Power Station so  don&rsquo;t forget  all the bits and bobs you&rsquo;ll need to achieve your aims, be it a  couple of  D-locks to secure your bike whilst you demonstrate, some  flotation aids in  case you decide to cool off in the river after a hard days  action, or  perhaps 3 pieces of scaffold pole securely joined together to  give you a  better view over the fence to the beautiful scenery behind.  Don&rsquo;t forget  as  you&rsquo;re planning to consider how you&rsquo;re going to get this stuff  there (and  back again for another day?) and divide up the load between  yourselves. If  your action absolutely depends on something, one person carrying  it all is  a  bad idea as if they wander off and get lost you may need to  hastily replan  your action.</li>
<li><strong>Small amount of cash</strong>.  May be really useful to get yourself out of a pickle,  particularly if  you&rsquo;re  making your own way there. There&rsquo;s no shops particularly nearby  to get  food/drink/cigs etc so you should already have all this with you  when you  arrive, but there&rsquo;s always the chance you were following a Sat  Nav and  ended  up at Ratcliffe on the Wreake in Leicester by accident. It  should be noted  that bringing a cash card is a bad idea if you don&rsquo;t want to be  identified  (along with any other kind of ID &ndash; leave it at home unless you are a  driver,  in which case you will need your license with you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stuff to avoid</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some stuff we very strongly  recommend you do  NOT bring with you!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knives</strong>. (or anything that could be considered a weapon)  You can guarantee that the next days papers will be full of &ldquo;Bumper  weapons  haul seized at power plant action&rdquo;, despite the fact that you were  dividing  up a carrot between your mates. Plan your food so that you won&rsquo;t  need a  knife, and there&rsquo;s always another way of cutting string etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dogs</strong>.  The little ones can get really stressed out on actions like this  and it  won&rsquo;t be very fun for them. Also consider what will happen to  them if you  find yourself unexpectedly detained for any reason. Even those  seemingly  inseperable from their furry friends will be making dog-sitting  arrangements  for a large action like this.</li>
<li><strong>Booze/Drugs</strong>.  Quite apart from the lack of toilets and overpriced bags of  salted peanuts  at the action, alcohol will dehydrate you very quickly (and may  well turn  you into a liability for others) and taking drugs into an area  that is  likely to be heavily policed and which may have a blanket stop  and search  policy in place is clearly a bad idea. Keep a clear head and  focus on why  everyone is here and you&rsquo;ll soon find out that it&rsquo;s a much  better way to  spend a saturday night out with your mates!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
