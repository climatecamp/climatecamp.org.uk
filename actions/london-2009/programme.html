      <h3 id="blurb_16">Why Economics is Destroying the Climate: for beginners</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MM1</strong>,
        Fri,
        10:30-11:30
      </p>
      <p>The aim of this workshop is to create an overview of the global economy, with an emphasis on the ideologies behind the free market, and the way that environmental
destruction is justified within it. Economics is about more than money, resources, and the circulation of goods. It has as much to do with the circulation of power, and of ideas, and how they shape us and our society in ways it is sometimes hard to see.

      <p>
        <strong>MM2</strong>,
        Fri,
        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>London is the biggest centre of world mining finance and many of the biggest mining companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange. Most British workers' pension funds invest in destructive mining companies. What's happening and what can we do about it?</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_26">Bretton Woods Project: World Bank and cliamte finance</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MM1</strong>,
        Mon,
        10:30-11:30
      </p>
      <p>The World Bank likes to think of itself as a leader on climate change, with the West funding it to the tilt to play this role. 
 
With an insatiable thirst for fossil fuel projects and a limited role for developing countries in its decision-making the Bank is more of a wolf in sheep skins clothing. Many say the Bank should clean up its act and step out of climate finance to let a more equitable organisation such as the UN take the lead. Come learn about new developments and what to keep your eye on in the months up to Copenhagen and beyond and brainstorm about ways to campaign on these issues.

      <h3 id="blurb_37">Carbon Trading, Heathrow & Kingsnorth: an intro</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>SM1</strong>,
        Fri,
        16:30-18:30
      </p>
      <p>Everything you wanted to know about carbon trading (but were afraid to ask). If you don't yet know your cap-and-trade from your offsets, come along and find out the basics about carbon markets and why they fail. The workshop will also look at how carbon trading relates to key climate change struggles in the UK, discussing whether carbon trading makes it more likely that a new coal power station at Kingsnorth, and third runway at Heathrow, will be built.</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_39">MELTDOWN: the economic crisis and the climate crisis</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Plenary MM</strong>,
        Fri,
        20-21:30
      </p>
      <p>Why is climate camp in the city this year?  Can we stop climate change within a capitalist market economy? If not, then what kind of economic system might deliver environmental stability and a decent quality of life for all?  And how can we go about achieving it, given how powerful capitalism is as an ideology, and the time-frame within which we need to act to prevent runaway climate change?  To tackle these critical questions, we are joined by: Nick Hildyard, of the Corner House; 
Molly Scot Cato - a green economist and the Economic spokeswoman for the Green party;
Keir Milburn, co-editor of the Turbulance journal, and
Claire Faucet - former researcher for corporate watch; author of Technofixes: a critical guide to climate change technologies" and involved with radical worker and housing cooperatives.

      <p>
        <strong>Space 9</strong>,
        Mon,
        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>It is widely agreed that our economy cannot continue to grow indefinitely.  Environmental damage and resource depletion will see to that.  And yet, if growth were to be halted, then the economy would be destroyed in another way: it is a dynamic system which (like a bicycle) depends on forward movement to maintain its stability.  This is the growth curse.  The market economy is damned if it grows, and damned if it doesn’t.

There are solutions to this, but they are very difficult ones, extending far beyond a reform of the financial system.  The workshop will explore them.  

David Fleming is an economist, inventor of Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs), and author of Lean Logic: The Empowerment Dictionary (forthcoming).</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_72">The Green New Deal</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>SM2</strong>,
        Mon,
        16:30-18:30
      </p>
      <p>Published in July 2008, The Green New Deal claims to be a blueprint for transforming society with huge investment in green technology and sweeping reform of the financial system.  Is the Green New Deal the only plausible route to significant emissions cuts in the UK or just a distraction from the root causes of climate change?</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_79">Happiness and Growth: can we have both?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MM1</strong>,
        Sat,
        10:30-11:30
      </p>
      <p>Wellbeing has been a major focus of scientific research over recent years and the evidence is unequivocal: as our economies have grown so our quality of life and personal wellbeing has dramatically decreased. This workshop will explore the politics of happiness and its implications for the environmental movement. Speakers: Caroline Lucas, MEP for South East England and leader of the Green Party, Saamah Abdullah, Researcher on wellbeing, New Economics Foundation</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_81">Alternatives to Money: timebanks and local currencies</h3>

        <strong>MM3</strong>,
        Sat,
        10:30-11:30
      </p>
      <p>Capitalism is failing communities, but all sorts of new kinds economic activity are emerging, such as timebanks, credit unions and alternative currencies, that profoundly challenge the dogma of markets. This workshops looks at these new approaches, explores some examples, such as the Brixton Pound, and asks how far can these schemes go? Speakers Josef Davies-Coates of United Diversity, and Josh Ryan-Collins, Researcher at the New Economics Foundation.</p>

      <h3 id="blurb_129">Building within Environmental Limits</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>SM1</strong>,
        Sun,
        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>What is the carbon involved in building an airport, a mile of new highway or an ecotown? How does building 3 million new homes impact our UK emissions? What does industry and government need to reduce emissions?</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_130">Consuming the Planet: Consumerism and capitalism</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MM2</strong>,
        Sun,
        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>In the last thirty years cunsumer capitalism has transformed our economic, cultural and actual landscape. The words "citizen"  and "consumer" have become interchangeable. We shop therefore we are. This workshop discusses consumerism, the waste it creates, the impact it has on our planet and on us and what we can do about it. Speakers: Neal Lawson, Chair of Compass and author of "All consuming", Tristram Stuart, Historian, author of "Waste: Uncovering the global food scandal" and (supermarket) skipper.</p>

        10:30-11:30
      </p>
      <p> short, introductory discussion outlining the history of ecological struggles in the workplace. This will be followed by an open debate/discussion focusing on some key practical issues:
_ How do we challenge the perceived divide between the workers and ecological movement? Why is it important?
_ What are the limitations of “Green” trade unions and how do we re-connect with rank-and-file workers?
_ What could a “Green New Deal” mean for us? How do we interact with workers tied into the carbon economy?</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_23">Policing of Women: Greenham, Rape, Race and Prostitution</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MM3</strong>,

        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>Previously inflicted with impunity on Black and other working class people and activists, police violence has been caught on film by G20 protesters.  Women have spearheaded movements for police accountability over the past three decades.  What can we learn from each other?</p>
      <h3 id="blurb_25">Climate Camp Cymru -  building the movement in Wales</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Space 9</strong>,
        Fri,
        14:30-16:00
      </p>
      <p>Climate Camp Cymru - Wales's first Camp for Climate Action -  pitched its tents in Merthyr Tydfil, next door to one of Europes largest open cast coal mines in mid-August to draw attention to the continued hypocracy of governments while building the movement taking action on climate change. What were their experances and where next?</p>

      <p>The idea behind Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics is to demystify direct action, to give it a face, and empower YOU to feel that you can acquire the skills to take action! With each session we are using stories that will lead to trying out a range of tactics (using d-locks, banner drop, glue, blockading, vehicles). An activist will tell the story of an action they’ve been involved in that many people will have at least heard of, and then the action will be simulated so you can try out the specific tactic used. The programme looks like this:

Fri 28th: Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics: Plane Stupid's Parliament Action; Alternative media
Sat 29th: Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics: The Drax 29 Coal Train Action
Sun 30th: Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics: The Stansted Action; Harris fencing & D-locks
Mon 31st: Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics: Faslane 365; Blockading with vehicles
Tue 1st: Sharing Stories, Trying Tactics: Greenpeace's Kingsnorth Action; Ropework</p>

      <p>Once upon a time photography was for the professionals.

Happily, times have moved on and accessable technology means that everyone's a photographer now. The massive documentation of G20 by "citizen journalists" led to a unique exposure of police tactics and  
brutality and won activists the pr battle and huge public support.

But it's not just about easy technology. And sometimes you might want to tell a story rather than just provide evidence.

There are some skills that can be easily taught that will improve the way you communicate with pictures, and there are some misconceptions about what you may and may not photograph. We aim in a short workshop to address these issues and answer any question you might put to us</p>

        Sat,
        16:30-18:30
      </p>
      <p>"The tar sands development in Alberta, Canada, has been called 'the biggest environmental crime in history':
- Millions of barrels of oil a day are now being extracted from what is currently the largest industrial development in the world. The toxic tailings ponds are so huge they are visible from space.
- It is the filthiest, most resource intensive, most polluting source of oil on the planet, and it is poisoning the indigenous people on whose land it has been imposed.
- If all the permits for extraction granted by the Canadian Government are fulfilled, there would be a hike in CO2 from this alone that would be enough to push the world past the 2 degrees C threshold that will precipitate catastrophic climate change.
- Tar Sands is the central plank to the US's plans for 'energy independence', and expansion plans over the next decades are mind-boggling.
- While it's happening in Canada, it's being driven from the square mile. Shell and BP, whilst continuing to trumpet their green credentials, are up to their necks in it, backed by the full financial weight of the City's investors, including RBS, HSBC and Barclays. And yet hardly anyone in the UK knows about it.

We need to build a powerful UK campaign to stop the tar sands. Come to this workshop to meet indigenous tar sands activists from Alberta, learn about what's happening to their homeland, and get involved in the campaign."</p>

        Sun,
        16:30-18:30
      </p>
      <p>Drax is the largest source of carbon emissions in the uk. Its impact is now known to be huge: it is responsible for 180 deaths a year, £3m a day costs in
the UK, and the death of 1200 species over its lifetime. Drax is set to be decommissioned by 2038 by the latest, and in the meantime it has no plan to significantly reduce its emissions or adopt carbon capture and storage. Given that Drax's huge emissions are pushing us quickly towards runaway climate change, it cannot be allowed to exist till the 2030s, and it is a significant obstacle to the UK's transition to a low carbon economy. To give us a fighting chance at saving humanity, Drax, and other carbon dinosaurs like it, need to be phased out over the next 10 years. This workshop will discuss why and how in more detail and call for a growing campaign to close Drax in the next 10 years.

What  hope do small, under-resourced organsiations have in taking on the  legal might of the government and what do they hope to achieve by it?  Demystifying the judicial review process, this workshop will look at  the campaigning strategy behind a legal process which attempts to hold the government to account.

From medieval university strikes through to the 68 student uprisings and the student activism which helped topple Miloševi&#263; in 1997. This participative workshop will guide you through the history of student protest looking at key events, as well as reflecting on what the future holds for student agitation.</p>

      <p>Last year People & Planet Associated Network for Direct Action  (PANDA) did a great action during Climate Camp. Just over twenty students took
part in a creative die-in / blockade of RBS HQ complete with oil slicks and narrating death. It was a really fun action and created lots of disruption for RBS and got us some media attention. The action was planned and taken during the Climate Camp itself. This year we're hoping that another PANDA action will take place at Climate Camp so if you'd like to be part of a fun affinity action with other P&Pers please come along and plan an action for the following Tue or weds.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In December 2006, a little known energy company named EON put in an application to a local Kent district council to build a brand new coal fired power station down at Kingsnorth in Kent. At the time, EON expected the application to be fast tracked through the planning process and for construction to start in 2009. Since then, a unique coalition of groups and interests have come together to bring the plans for Kingsnorth to a standstill, making it the fulcrum of one of the most iconic climate change campaigns anywhere in the world. Come to the workshop on the future of coal to find out how the campaign developed, and where we go from here to rule out climate damaging emissions from new coal fired power stations for good.

 

Jim Footner is an energy campaigner for Greenpeace UK, and has led the Greenpeace Kingsnorth campaign since it’s beginning in January 2007.</p>

      <p>When many women and feminist organisations first went to join picket lines and demonstrations in the great miners' strike of 1984-85 they were met with appalling sexism. Likewise, the role of women in mining families up to that point had been one of housewives and mothers. However, the experience of the strike, the instrumental role played by women in organising, led to a huge shift in the attitudes of the [male] miners to women, and above all those womens' attitudes to themselves and their role in society. What are the lessons now for bringing ecological politics into workers' struggles where attitudes to the environment may be, right now fairly backward?</p>

Tue’s All-day Discussion in
the Main Marquee:
For one day only the main marquee will be dedicated to reviewing The Camp for Climate Action: our achievements, our process and our strategy over the last 4 years. As well as being an opportunity to celebrate all the hard work, movement building and action we’ve taken in the past, it will provide a space for reflection: a chance to have your say about the camp and hear what everybody else thinks. Do we need to work harder on our media image? Or are we too media obsessed? Are we too liberal, or too worried about being radical enough? Are we diverse enough? Have we become consumerist? Should we be working with NGO’s? Why does it matter? And who are ‘we’, anyway? Does our organising process reflect our politics? Is it efficient? What can we do differently? What works? What do we love about what we do? Where do we go next?
The day will be a mixture of small and large group work, mass plenaries, physical games, open space discussions and inspiring presentations.
Come with an open and positive mind, we need critique but not criticism, we want to build our movement not unravel it!</p>

What is going to be discussed at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December? What is carbon trading, and why should we care? What role does the European Union play? Discussions on a new global climate agreement are shrouded in a cloud of acronyms and obscure market schemes. This workshop decodes what is at stake in Copenhagen, exposing how the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), sectoral carbon markets, and schemes aimed at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) would exacerbate local social and environmental conflicts and incentivise land grabs whilst failing to tackle the climate crisis. It will then explore some alternatives needed to promote climate justice in the UK, the EU and beyond.</p>
