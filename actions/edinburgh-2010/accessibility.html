  <h1>Accessibility</h1>
  
    <p>We aim to make the camp as accessible to everyone as we can. Unfortunately there are some accessibility limitations due to the camp being in a field, and to our limited budget. Below is information about what provision is already in place and what issues may arise; if you have specific requirements or questions, please get in touch and we'll do as much as we can to assist.  Note that there will be a designated accessible neighbourhood for camping (which will be close to the disabled access toilet) -- check at Welcome on arrival where this is.</p>
<h2>Access Codes (from Sisters against Disablement)</h2>
<p><strong>Parking and public transport</strong>: we won't have information about this until the time of the camp. If you need to bring a vehicle, please let us know and we will try to make arrangements. Unfortunately we can't guarantee that the police won't intervene.</p>
<p><strong>Gate, entrance, and spaces</strong>: it's an outdoor field site, so all structures are tents or marquees. All marquees should be accessible, but some small tents may be difficult to access. If you know that you definitely need access to a particular working group space, please let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Floor surface</strong>: wheelchair access boards will be laid around all central areas, and within the designated accessible neighbourhood.  If the site is hilly, the main areas and the accessible neighbourhood will be on the flattest bits and accessible from the main gate.  Again, as it's a field site, even with boards down it's unlikely to be perfectly flat.<strong>Toilets</strong>: there will be an accessible toilet.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong>: mostly natural light. Electric light after dark will be very limited.</p>
<p><strong>Seating</strong>: very little is provided (some hay bales). If you need to be able to sit down and you can bring a camping chair with you, please do. People with limited ability to stand should get priority for the haybale seating, so do please ask if it's already occupied.</p>
<p><strong>Heating</strong>: outdoor site (in Scotland!), no heating.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong>: if you need BSL interpretation, we may be able to find an interpreter onsite, but can't guarantee that. In general, unfortunately there is no provision for fingerspelling, lip speakers, braille, or anything similar.</p>
<p><strong>Assistance</strong>: if you need assistance, please ask at the welcome tent.</p>
<p><strong>Creche</strong>: there is a kids' space available during the daytime throughout the camp.</p>
<p><strong>Food and drink</strong>: all food available onsite is vegan, and there will be three meals available per day (at least two hot meals). Snack food will probably not be available outside of those times. We can't guarantee gluten-free or nut-free food, so if you have allergies, please bring food with you. It's not a good idea to count on being able to go off-site to eat, as there may be some police searches or other hassle. Tap water is freely available.</p>
<p><strong>Smoking</strong>: all marquees should be smoke-free. People will be smoking outside.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of activities</strong>: workshops generally last 1.5-2 hours, between around 10.30 and 6.30 (with a lunch break!). There will be a morning meeting lasting 1 hour in each neighbourhood. None of this is compulsory! There will also be a main action on the Monday of the camp.</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>Camp can be quite a noisy and stressful environment. There is quiet space available if you're experiencing distress, in the Wellbeing tent. There will hopefully also be volunteers there from Activist Trauma Support if you need someone to talk to, but we can't provide counselling.  Workshops can get quite crowded in some cases.  Support animals are welcome. We don't yet know if the space will permit other animals (and won't do until the time).  In general, if you do have any particular access requirements, or any concerns, please contact us in advance, so we can plan how to meet them.</p>
<h2>Accessibility help</h2>
<p>If you have any special skills such as BSL, lip-speaking, personal assistant experience, etc etc, and might be prepared to do help out whilst at the camp, please let us know!</p>
<p>(Note that personal assistance differs from traditional care in that assistance is directed by the disabled person, giving them choice and control, rather than being provided for them and directed by the provider.)</p>
<p>In general, if someone looks like they might need assistance, **ask** them if they need help. Don't assume! If they do need help, listen to what they're asking for, don't assume that you know best.</p>
