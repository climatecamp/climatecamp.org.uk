  <h1>Logistics</h1>
  
    <p>Much of this information is provisional, but we are working closely with our friends in Denmark to firm up this information, so keep checking this page! If you have any further questions, email us at international[@]climatecamp.org.uk.</p>
<h2>Where will I stay?</h2>
<div><span>Various spaces are being prepared to accomodate activists coming to Copenhagen. &nbsp;They are large heated halls with floor and bed-frame space but no mattresses, so bring roll mats and warm sleeping bags. Costs are by donation only.</span><span><br></span><span><br>To help the logistics team gauge numbers, go to&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.climate-justice-action.org/practical-info/let-us-know-youre-coming/ " target="_blank">http://www.climate-justice-action.org/practical-info/let-us-know-youre-coming</a>. </span><br><br>If you are able to set of to Copenhagen sooner - ie anytime from now! - get in touch with the logistics team via </span>logistics.cop15[at]gmail.com<span><span><span> and help prepare the accommodation spaces... and start plotting bunk bed designs!</span></span></span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>Climate Camp will all be accommodated in the same space to make it easy for us all to meet up with people we know and form affinity groups - although of course a massive part of this mobilisation is meeting people from around the world and reclaiming power together, it's also sometimes nice to see a familiar face! &nbsp;Any climate campers arriving in Copenhagen before or after the coaches via their own transport should find a CJA info point and ask which accommodation space Climate Camp is in to link up with each other.</span><span><br><br></span></div>
<div><span>Alternatively, to&nbsp;<span>stay with individuals in Copenhagen, try&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newlifecopenhagen.com/" target="_blank">New Life Copenhagen</a>, or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/wiki/Copenhagen" target="_blank">Copenhagen couch-surfing website</a>.<br><br></span></span></div>
<h2>How much will it cost?</h2>
<p>Copenhagen is an expensive city - don&rsquo;t plan on meals out! Denmark use the Krone (DKK) as currency, which works out at about DKK8.5 to the pound. An average coffee is DKK25, a pint of beer is DKK40 - 50, a small can of beer in a shop is DKK5 - 10, and a sandwich is DKK40-50.</p>
<p>You can expect to find food at convergence centres, which is likely to be on donation basis.</p>
<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>There are three regular ways of getting there, coach, ferry or train. A return coach with Eurolines is around &pound;100, a return train via Brussels costs around &pound;200, or a return ferry from Harwich to Ejsberg with a connecting train, which also costs around &pound;200.</p>
<p>Climate Camp is organising coaches to Copenhagen, leaving from Leeds and London on Friday 11 December and coming back on Saturday 19 December, &pound;100 return. Travelling with others is the best way to build affinity and arrive in Copenhagen knowing what's going on. <a href="http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/copenhagen-2009/coaches">Full details here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p>There is a train being organised by the Campaign against Climate Change, departing on the 18th and returning on the 20th December. This is a useful for a short trip, but we are encouraging people to come out for a longer period where you get to participate in building a movement for change, rather than backing a policy suggestion.</p>
<h2>How do I get around?</h2>
<p>Copenhagen is considered to be one of the best cities in the world for cycling. If you can bring your bike, you won&rsquo;t need to use any transport at all. You can also <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/wiki/Copenhagen#Bikes.21">rent bikes</a>.</p>
<p>Copenhagen has a <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/wiki/Copenhagen#Metro">metro and bus service</a>. The metro runs until around 1am.</p>
<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
<p>DO bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Sleeping bag</li>
<li>&nbsp;Sleeping mat</li>
<li>&nbsp;Pillow</li>
<li>&nbsp;EHIC card (European Health Insurance Card)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Passport</li>
<li>&nbsp;Photocopy of passport (most European countries insist on you carrying around ID with you at all times, although this is rarely enforced, but useful all the same in case you lose your passport or if it is stolen)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Adaptor plug (2 round pins NOT 2 straight pins)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Danish Krone (approx. 8.4 Krone to the pound)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Euros (in case you want to buy any food/drink en route through France/Germany)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Mobile phone with plenty of credit (+45 for Danish numbers)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Torch (with spare batteries)</li>
<li>&nbsp;1st aid kit + painkillers if necessary (in some European countries it is hard to get Paracetamol/Ibuprofen anywhere other than pharmacies</li>
<li>&nbsp;Any medication you need (it can often be difficult to get medication abroad)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Waterproofs</li>
<li>&nbsp;Plenty of warm clothes</li>
<li>&nbsp;Flask</li>
<li>&nbsp;Loo roll for the coaches (<strong>Important</strong>: if you are travelling on one of the Climate Camp coaches, <strong>there are no coach toilets</strong> - there will be regular stops for your bodily needs but bring loo roll anyway because service station toilets aren't great either).</li>
<li>&nbsp;Plenty of enthusiasm</li>
</ul>
<p>DON&rsquo;T bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conspicuous equipment for direct action (border searches on coaches are usually fairly thorough and you don&rsquo;t want to jeopardise your chances of getting into the country. On trains this is less of an issue as luggage checks are restricted to the Eurostar)</li>
<li>Knives or bladed objects other than razors (again you don&rsquo;t want to give the Danish authorities any reason to not let you in!)</li>
<li>Drugs (it may seem obvious, but it's really not worth it)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I do when I arrive in Copenhagen?</h2>
<p>Closer to the time, more information will be available about convergence spaces, which are a good place to head for when you arrive.</p>
<p>A handful of us will be on the ground ahead of the event, and will be contactable when you arrive. Contact email and phone numbers will be available for them closer to the time. If you are able to get out to Copenhagen a few days early and help out, let us know by emailing international[@]climatecamp.org.uk.</p>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>To get a good overview of the law from an &lsquo;activist&rsquo; perspective, visit <a href="http://www.blackcross.dk/bustcards/la_english.asp">http://www.blackcross.dk/bustcards/la_english.asp</a></p>
<h2><strong>Coaches to Copenhagen</strong></h2>
<p>From the 7th to 18th of December 2009, the largest &lsquo;climate summit&rsquo; ever to be held will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark. This summit has been billed as our &lsquo;last, best hope&rsquo; to do something about climate change. But as emissions continue to rise and talks focus on false solutions that allow climate criminals to pollute and profit, it is time to say enough - no more business as usual! Come and join the Climate Camp with thousands of other activists from around the world as we converge on the summit to Reclaim Power!</p>
<p>Climate Camp coaches depart the UK on Friday 11th December, arriving in Copenhagen on the morning of the 12th, departing from two locations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leeds - departs at 08.00 from the Common Place Social Centre </strong>(NB. This has changed from the original 10.00 due to the risk of missing ferries)<strong><br></strong> </li>
<li><strong>London - departs 15.30 from London Embankment</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The coaches leave Copenhagen on Friday the 18th December, arriving back into the UK on the 19th. The cost of the return ticket is &pound;130, and cannot be booked one-way.</p>
<h2>Update 8nd December</h2>
<p>We are waiting for a few payments but for all intents and purposes the coaches are full. We have a list of people who want a place and have had a few drop outs so if you are interested and willing to drop everything at the last minute to get on a coach pleqase email cop15coach[@]climatecamp.org.uk.<br>&nbsp;<br>Please ensure you have a booking reference when coming to the coaches.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>YOUR TICKET IS NOT CONFIRMED UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID AND BEEN GIVEN A BOOKING REFERENCE. UNTIL YOU HAVE A BOOKING REFERENCE YOU DO NOT HAVE A TICKET, SO IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A TICKET BUT DON'T HAVE A BOOKING REFERENCE YOU DO NOT IN FACT HAVE A TICKET AND SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck everyone.</p>
