<h1>A Space for Change</h1>
<p class="meta">February 21 - February 27</p>
<div id="wiki_html">
<p><strong>BOOKED UP</strong></p>
<p>If you havn't booked already, we are sorry to inform you that it's too late. All the spaces are currently booked up. It&rsquo;s great to see that so many people feel like now is the right time to get together for a solid 6 days and get creative together.</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>Space for Change is for people who have in some way been involved in UK climate activism on an anti-capitalist, grassroots level that sees the limits of state-based solutions and organises non-hierarchically along anarchist principles. Although it is not strictly for people who have been involved in the Camp for Climate Action, it has been organised along a mandate from a CfCA gathering which wanted a space to deal with issues and concerns that had built up in CfCA over five years&rsquo; of political organising.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to clarify that S4C will be organised using open space style techniques, therefore the agenda will not be designed beforehand. If you would like to share knowledge at the event, come prepared. There is a crabgrass group where people can get involved in pre-event discussions, see <a href="http://we.riseup.net/s4c_agenda" target="_blank">we.riseup.net/s4c_agenda</a></p>
<p>If you have already paid a deposit but in light of this email think that this event isn&rsquo;t for you &ndash; no problem, we can reimburse you, please just email spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk letting us know.</p>
<p>And another thing&hellip;Our hosts have offered us a rock-bottom price with the understanding that we can all help with some of their building projects, so please be prepared to spend some time pitching in.</p>
<p>And finally&hellip;Can you help facilitate?</p>
<p>It would be great for facilitation during the week to be shared out as much as possible, particularly with people who have not already facilitated lots at Climate Camp gatherings. So, if you have some experience and would be up for helping out with this please email<a href="mailto:spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk"> spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk</a> . If a facilitation training would boost your confidence, some are being organised in Manchester and London, let us know if you want to go to one. It would also be great to hear from people with skills beyond facilitation, with experience in open space discussions and trust-building processes.</p>
<p><strong>More information about A Space for Change</strong>:</p>
<div>Dates: Dinner at 7pm, Monday 21st &ndash; early afternoon Sunday 27th of February. You are welcome for any or all of the week.</div>
<p>Contact us: spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I come along with someone who has already booked / sleep somewheree else and just come along for the days?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Unfortunately not, as it is not just sleeping space that we are at naximum capacity for, but also how many we can cater for and how much space there is in the meeting rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I really don&rsquo;t want to enter my personal information into an online form. What should I do?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> You&rsquo;ll need to enter a name for the booking form &ndash;  we don&rsquo;t mind if its real or fake, as long as you remember it! The  system needs a contact email address &ndash; if you dont want to give it to  us, ask a friend to book for you or set up a new account. Apart from a  name and email, please don&rsquo;t give us any more details.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to come, but my bank doesn&rsquo;t have the facilities to let me pay my deposit in advance. What should I do?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> The best way to get around this is to find out if  anyone you know is going, and get them to book a place for you. If  that&rsquo;s definitely not an option, email spaceforchange@ to explain your  situation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to come, but I can&rsquo;t afford to pay the deposit in advance. What should I do?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> If you&rsquo;re absolutely sure you&rsquo;ll be coming, email spaceforchange@ to let us know and we&rsquo;ll save a place for you.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why does it cost so much?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> For this event, we&rsquo;re having to cover venue costs,  including acccomodation, food and firewood. Space for Change will also  be making a contribution to the travel pool.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to come, but I can&rsquo;t afford to contribute the full amount. What should I do?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> Just pay what you think is fair. Costs above the &pound;15 non-refundable deposit are on a donation basis,  recommended &pound;30 - &pound;50 depending on means. It would be helpful  if you could email spaceforchange@ to let us know what your  contribution is likely to be. If you have trouble with the  &pound;15 deposit please contact us. Cost should not be a reason not to come.</p>
<p><strong>Q: It&rsquo;s going to cost me a lot of money to get to Dorset. Why is it so far away?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> Monkton Wyld is exactly the kind of venue we wanted  for this event, and which ever part of the country we decided on would  have involved inconvenient travel costs for someone. The last few events  have been in Manchester or Scotland so spare a thought for the Devon  &amp; Kernow crew. If you&rsquo;re facing a hefty train fare, don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; we  are making arrangements for a travel pool that should cover most of  your travel costs.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What do I need to bring?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> No bedding will be provided by the venue, so bring  whatever bedding you feel you&rsquo;ll need: sleeping bag, duvet, blankets,  roll mat, pillow, etc.</p>
