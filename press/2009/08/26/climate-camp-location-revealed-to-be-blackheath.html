  <h1>Climate Camp Location Revealed to be Blackheath</h1>
  
    
<p class="intro">August 26, 2009</p>
<p>Today at 14:00, the location of the Climate Camp 2009 was revealed as Blackheath Common, in central London. Over one thousand people took part in a swoop across London and are beginning to descend onto the site. The site for the Camp, which was kept top-secret until the last moment, was communicated to the Swoopers signed up to the mass-texting service and Climate Camp Twitter. [1]<br />
<br />
Blackheath, in clear sight of the London City skyline which symbolises the financial and corporate centres of power. It is easily accessible from Blackheath Tube station and Greenwich Station. <br />
<br />
Using slogans like &ldquo;Nature Doesn&rsquo;t Do Bailouts&rdquo;, the Camp for Climate Action is demonstrating how the same disastrous reasoning that caused the economic recession is responsible for continuously rising emissions. Having previously camped at sites of climate crime such as Drax, Heathrow, Kingsnorth and the Climate Exchange on Bishopsgate, today the Camp for Climate Action is setting up camp at the doorstep of the economic and political systems that are fuelling catastrophic climate change. <br />
<br />
Lizzie Jacobs, a Camper who is participating in the Swoop, said:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Swoop is one of the most inspiring events to take part in, but it's only the beginning! So many people coming together because they care about climate change, and they recognise that the government and big businesses are not and cannot give us solutions to the climate crisis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This year the Camp is pitching its tents at the doorstep of the root causes of climate change. That's why we're in London, it's the hub of climate business and a symbol of the failed political and economic systems that are causing climate catastrophe. I'm really looking forward to the next week: it will be packed with opportunities to learn and to build a movement that is taking action on climate change. Climate change is relevant to absolutely everyone, so everyone is invited to come down to the Camp to find out more and join together to demand and create a more sustainable society.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Camp is open to everyone for a week of climate and economics educational workshops, sustainable living and direct action discussion and training. The Camp will end on Wednesday 2 September.<br />
<br />
