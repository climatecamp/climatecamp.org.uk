  <h1>Climate Activists Slam New Kingsnorth Policing Report As &quot;Whitewash&quot;</h1>
  
    
<p class="intro">July 22, 2009</p>
<p>Campaigners from the Camp for Climate Action have criticised today's report into the policing of the 2008 camp at Kingsnorth as a &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo;. They claim that it lets the police off lightly and avoids the real problems with the heavy-handed policing of climate protest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kent.police.uk/News/Latest_News/Climate%20camp%20report.html">The report</a>, released earlier today, was carried out by officers from South Yorkshire police and aimed to review policing tactics following the Climate Camp near Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in August 2008. But members of the Climate Camp have accused the authors of the report of &quot;tinkering around the edges&quot; of the problem, and not tackling the real issues. Sarah Horne, a member of the Climate Camp's legal support team, said:</p>
<p>&quot;The report does contain some mild criticism of Kent police, suggesting that they could have done better at assessing the situation before launching such a massive, multi-million pound policing operation. This is an enormous understatement. The Camp represented no threat to the public &ndash; even if we had shut down the power station, there would have been no loss of power in Kent because there&rsquo;s spare capacity in the National Grid. The only things at risk from the Camp were E.ON&rsquo;s profits and the Government&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite this, Kent Police ran a huge, over-the-top operation involving thousands of stops-and-searches, confiscations, violence and harassment against people attending a legal protest camp. However, the protesters remained calm and non-violent, and the only injuries to the police were from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/15/kingsnorth-climate-change-environment-police">bee stings, backache and sunstroke</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A legal challenge has been launched against police tactics at the Kingsnorth Camp, and is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Xavier Perez, another Climate Camper, said: &ldquo;The police use these bullying and intimidating tactics to try to deter people from protest &ndash; but they won&rsquo;t succeed. The urgency of climate change means that more and more people are ready to take effective action against the root causes of the problem &ndash; not just runways and power stations, but the growth-based economic system that encourages them. The real test for the police will be when the Climate Camp pops up again in London this August 27th &ndash; and we&rsquo;re hoping that thousands of people will join us, to show that they won&rsquo;t let police harassment prevent them from doing what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
