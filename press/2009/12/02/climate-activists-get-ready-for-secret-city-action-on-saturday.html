  <h1>Climate Activists Get Ready for Secret City Action on Saturday</h1>
  
    
<p class="intro">December 02, 2009</p>
<p>Hundreds of climate activists are preparing to take action this weekend in the run up to the COP15 talks in Copenhagen next week.</p>
<p>The 'COP out, Camp out', organised by a group of people who met at the Camp for Climate Action in Blackheath in the Summer (1), is designed to take place after thousands of people march through the capital as part of 'The Wave' on Saturday afternoon. (2)</p>
<p>Tracy Worthy from the Camp for Climate Action said: "These elitist and undemocratic talks are part of a political and economic system that puts corporate profits before the needs of people. We need system change, not climate change."</p>
<p>The location of the camp will be kept secret until the last minute, when the target will be announced through mass text-messaging, which can be signed up to on the Climate Camp website. (3)</p>
<p>When asked where the protest will be, Jacob Murovitz, a climate activist who was at the G20 protests, replied: "There are all sort of banks, corporations and government departments in London which fuel climate change. The false solutions being pushed in Copenhagen, such as carbon trading, will not solve the climate crisis. (4)</p>
<p>Jacob continued: "For the bankers and politicians who brought us the financial crisis, it&rsquo;s no more than business as usual."</p>
<p>When asked about the reaction of the Met, who issued a statement about the camp earlier today, Richard Bernard, a spokesperson for the Camp, replied: "Most of what we do is really public so that everyone can join in. We've limited our location to within 4 boroughs, even though we have no obligation to tell the police about where we're going to protest next.</p>
<p>"We went to them to set up liason on the day. But it really doesn't help relations between protesters and police that the Met feel the need to start panicking before we've even set up camp. We still don't trust them and this doesn't help."</p>
