  <h1>Global alliances announce they will protest 15 years of failed climate negotiations with mass non-violent civil disobedience</h1>
  
    
<p class="intro">December 15, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Civil Society  Groups Inside and Outside The COP Process Issue Call to Unite in  &ldquo;Peoples&rsquo; Assembly&rdquo; to Demand Real Solutions to the Climate Crisis</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As broad frustration grows with rich country and corporate influence  over the content and direction of the climate negotiations, two international  networks of people&rsquo;s movements, civil society groups, Indigenous Peoples&rsquo;  Organizations and grassroots activists united to announce a mass non-violent  civil disobedience to expose the failure of the COP process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives of the networks,  Climate Justice Action and Climate Justice Now!, have declared that  given the urgency of the climate crisis it is time for dramatic action  to expose the COP process as undemocratic, unjust and inadequate to  deal with the scale of the problem. The action called for Wednesday  December 16<sup>th</sup> will involve groups of activists simultaneously  descending on the Conference centre from different starting points.  At noon, they will join up with the mass of people walking out of the  climate talks, to hold the &lsquo;Peoples&rsquo; Assembly&rsquo;, a participatory  platform of marginalized voices and real solutions to climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the last 15 years,  the COP process has been corrupted by corporate money and the refusal  of the rich countries of the world to take responsibility for the problems  they have created. At a very fundamental level, we need to talk about  how we leave fossil fuels in the ground, but no one is talking about  that inside the talks in Copenhagen,&rdquo; said Ivonne Yanez of Accion  Ecologica, which is a part of Climate Justice Now!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Africans from inside the  Bella Centre are proud to be reaching out and standing with our brothers  and sisters outside. We stand with them against a deal that will kill  Africa. President Obama cannot come here and sign the death warrant  of literally millions of Africans. Instead, he should come and march  with us, listen to us, and commit to a just, long-term deal that stops  climate change and keeps our people alive,&rdquo; said Mithika Mwenda of  Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We have no more time  to waste.&nbsp; If governments won&rsquo;t solve the problem then its time  for our diverse people&rsquo;s movements to unite and reclaim the power  to shape our future. We are beginning this process with the people&rsquo;s  assembly.&nbsp; We will join together all the voices that have been  excluded&mdash;both within the process and outside of it.&nbsp; We will  be both non-violent and confrontational. We will not let fences and  physical barriers stand in our way, and we call upon the police to respect  our right to make our voices heard. This is a global emergency. What  are you willing to do to insure our children&rsquo;s future?&rdquo; said Stine  Gry, a representative of Climate Justice Action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reclaim Power action will  bring together climate activists, representatives of climate-impacted  communities and Indigenous Peoples from around the world for the Peoples&rsquo;  Assembly that will take place on Wednesday, 16 December. The range of  actions will include not only participants in the COP process walking  out of the talks but also thousands of people who have been excluded  from the talks making their way into the grounds of the Bella Center.</p>
