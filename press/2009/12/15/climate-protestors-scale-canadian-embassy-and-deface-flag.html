  <h1>Climate Protestors Scale Canadian Embassy and Deface Flag</h1>
  
    
<p class="intro">December 15, 2009</p>
<p>At 8am this morning three climate activists scaled the entrance to the  Canadian High Commission in Grosvenor Square, cutting loose the Canadian flag.  They will then dunk the flag into crude oil while unfurling a banner reading  &ldquo;Shut Down the Tar Sands&rdquo;. The activists have secured themselves upon the  building&rsquo;s front balcony with one protestor super-glued to the window such that  it cannot be opened. This is the second action in London on Tar Sands in two  day, and is part of a growing international campaign [1].</p>
<p>This action is a response to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper  obstructing the progress of the summit in Copenhagen in order to protect  Canada&rsquo;s Tar Sands Industry [2]. Tar Sands are the dirtiest fuel known to man,  both in terms of their impact on the climate and the devastation inflicted on  the local communities [3]</p>
<p>There is an enormous open cast mine, covering the total size of England in  the Alberta Tar Sands region of Canada. This is the largest industrial  development in the world and is devastating for the indigenous communities that  live there, not only destroying the land itself but increasing levels of cancer,  poisoning much of their traditional food sources and leaving the water unsafe to  drink. [4] This violates the indigenous treaty rights legally bound to this  region.</p>
<p>The three activists who scaled the Canadian High Commission this morning have  just completed their 10th night in occupation of Trafalgar square with the Camp  for Climate Action [5]</p>
<p>Jake Colman, one of the climbers and a &lsquo;Climate Camper&rsquo; justifies his  actions: &ldquo;We are here to expose the greed driven agenda of Prime Minister Harper  and the corporate lobbyists of Shell and BP who have tainted Canada with dirty  oil and risk global catastrophe to selfishly profit from environmental and human  destruction. We in the UK play a large role in funding these murderous ventures  with the likes of <span>RBS</span> &ndash;now 84% publicly owned having  already invested billions, and BP currently preparing to move in to Tar Sands&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clayton Thomas-Muller, an Indigenous activist with the Indigenous  Environmental Network (<span>IEN</span>), speaks during the  Copenhagen summit: &ldquo;The Canadian government continues to ignore its own laws,  which state they must consult with Indigenous Peoples who have been trying to  convey concerns about Tar Sands development. Tar Sands are killing our  communities and trampling over our rights. Furthermore, the environmental  destruction wreaked by the Tar Sands is directly threatening thousands of lives  now and is driving our climate into chaos. The world has woken up to the fact  that Canada is now Public Climate Enemy Number One. It&rsquo;s time Canada did its  global duty and shut down the Tar Sands&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span>NOTES</span> TO <span>EDITORS</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monday 14th saw the road outside Canada House blockaded in anger of Harper and  Tar Sands: http://indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443459.html</li>
<li>Currently in  Copenhagen, Canada is proposing an inadequate target for reducing greenhouse  emissions by only 3% by 2020 ignoring world scientists&rsquo; recommendations to  commit to over 40% reductions below 1990 levels in order to avoid dangerous  runaway climate change. Canada has already completely failed to meet its  commitments to the Kyoto Treaty and refuses to sign the UN&rsquo;s Declaration of  Rights for Indigenous Peoples whilst continuing development of Tar Sands oil  extraction.</li>
<li>Tar Sands fuel is a way of extracting oil who&rsquo;s energy  intensive process has not only completely destroyed areas of the Boreal forests  the size of England, burns enough natural gas to power 6 hundred thousand homes  a year, produces lakes of toxic waste 66km wide which filters into all local life and drinking water but would itself be enough to push our  climate into chaos.http://tarsandsinfocus.wordpress.com/about/</li>
<li>http://tarsandsinfocus.wordpress.com/about/</li>
<li>http://climatecamp.org.uk</li>
<li>This is the start of a fast growing UK campaign  against Tar Sands. Although we do not receive oil directly from Canadian Tar  Sands, Corporations such as <span>RBS</span> which is now 84% owned  by the British Tax Payer invests billions and British Petroleum have plans to  move in to the &lsquo;Sun Rise&rsquo; site in the coming months. Action on these issues and  these corporations are soon to become a focus of UK activism as we begin to  stand up to International injustices such as Tar Sands in Canada.</li>
