  <h1>Working Groups</h1>
  
    <p>Most of the work for the Camp for Climate Action takes place in small working groups taking on specific responsibilities for different aspects of the Camp.</p>
<p>The Climate Camp process is run on a basis of trusting each other.&nbsp;A lot more gets done by small groups of people working on the details rather than bigger groups micromanaging every little thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to get involved in the Camp's work, one of the best ways is to join a working group. They are not like committees, in that they don't have elected members, so anyone can join and take part. You'll find details of all the working groups in this section.</p>
<p>Here is a list of current active working groups. Other temporary working groups will appear and disappear as and when we undertake different projects.</p>
<h2>Site Group</h2>
<p>Responsible for making the campsite function. Big job. Subgroups include: Marquees, Transport, Power, Kitchens, Toilets, Liaison, Comms, Defence, Plumbing, Visuals, and Grey water.<br>site[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Welcome and Tranquility group</h2>
<p>Welcomes people to the Camp, helps them settle in, and helps facilitate the camp being a safe space.<br>welcome[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Workshops group</h2>
<p>Organises the workshops programme at the camp.<br>workshops[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Action Support group</h2>
<p>Provides resources and training to support direct action.<br>actionsupport[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Meetings group</h2>
<p>The Meetings group facilitates the process of making consensus decisions at the Camp. At previous camps this has been done through neighbourhood meetings every morning feeding into a 'spokescouncil' meeting, where 'spokes' from each neighbourhood and working group make decisions about the Camp. There is also a system for making emergency decisions in the course of the day.<br>meetings[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Entertainment group</h2>
<p>Organise entertainment at the camp.<br>entertainment[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Kids Space</h2>
<p>We work to create a fantastic space on camp where children can go and engage and input into the camp and have a great time!<br>kids[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Medics group</h2>
<p>Formed of people whose skills range from first aid to clinical medicine.  We work together to increase self-sufficiency, mutual aid and the  availability of radical person-centred health care.  We aim to empower  others to take responsibility for their health needs and provide  comprehensive first aid.<br>medics[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2><a href="/get-involved/working-groups/activist-trauma-support">Activist Trauma Support group &raquo;</a></h2>
<p>Providing support for those affected by post-traumatic stress, burn-out, or upsetting experiences.<br>activist_trauma[at]riseup.net</p>
<h2>Outreach group</h2>
<p>Gets the Camp out there! In the run up to any major events, Outreach makes sure our events are as well known about - and inviting - as possible. During the summer camps, Outreach establishes links with the communities within which we are camping (local residents meetings, letters and tours).<br>outreach[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Website group</h2>
<p>Responsible for the maintenance of the website, while also keeping an  overview of its content and design. Liaises with the other working  groups to ensure website is relevant and up to date.<br>website[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Media group</h2>
<p>Liaises with the press as well as producing our own media. Find out more in the <a href="/press">press section</a>.<br>press[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2><a href="/get-involved/working-groups/legal">Legal group &raquo;</a></h2>
<p>Provides legal support for the Climate Camp's various activities.<br>legal[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Festivals group</h2>
<p>Organises our presence at Glastonbury and other festivals.<br>festivals[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Skillshare group</h2>
<p>A group to facilitate information and skill sharing across regions  and local groups. This isn't completely up and running yet so if you're  interested contact process[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2><a href="/get-involved/working-groups/international">International group &raquo;</a></h2>
<p>Responsible for international networking and information sharing, and ensuring Climate Camp UK is represented abroad.<br>international[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Process group</h2>
<p>Deals with the administrative work of the Climate Camp. It also keeps an overview of the Climate Camp process and watches out for gaps that need filling.<br>process[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Finance group</h2>
<p>Looks after the money, keeping the accounts and ensuring working groups spend within our means.<br>finance[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<h2>Gathering group</h2>
<p>Not so much a working group, as a role that rotates to whichever local group is hosting the UK gathering. They are responsible for sorting gathering practicalities, as well as setting the agenda with the help of the process group.<br>process[at]climatecamp.org.uk</p>
