  <h1>About Tar Sands</h1>
  
    <h2>Why Tar Sands?</h2>
<p><img class="left" src="/actions/bp-fortnight-of-shame-2010/FINAL_-_BP_Fortnight_of_Shame_-_Smaller.jpg" alt="">Attempts to avert the planet  from sliding into climate crisis are being threatened by a single massive  project in the Canadian wilderness. Already, millions of barrels of  tar sands oil are being extracted every day, producing three to five  times as many greenhouse gas emissions as conventional oil. The extraction  process is immensely resource-intensive, currently using enough natural  gas every day to heat 3.2 million Canadian homes. Add to this the mass  deforestation the projects are causing,  ridding us of desperately needed carbon sinks, and  it becomes clear this project cannot be allowed to continue if we are  serious about preventing runaway climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effects tar sands are  having on local First Nations communities are devastating. The tar sands  development in Alberta covers an area the size of England, with toxic  tailing ponds so huge they are visible from space, leaking  poisons into the local water supply. Not only are indigenous livelihoods  and futures being destroyed, but communities on land where tar sands  extraction has been imposed are experiencing disturbingly high rates  of rare forms of cancer and auto-immune diseases.</p>
<h2>Why BP?</h2>
<p>BP are the only major oil  company with no tar sands extraction  projects currently in operation. This is about to change. Since 2007,  BP have quietly ditched the 'Beyond Petroleum' sham, because  investing in renewables simply wasn't making them enough profit. They  have decided to go Back to Petroleum, with a vengeance,  under the leadership of new Chief Executive Tony Hayward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving into tar sands was  one of the first steps Tony Hayward took,, acquiring a half share in  the Sunrise Project with Husky Energy. The Sunrise Project will be huge,  producing 200,000 barrels of filthy oil a day, and using Steam-Assisted  Gravity Drainage (SAGD), an extraction process even more energy and  water intensive than the more visible surface-mining operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recession has given us  a window of opportunity. BP have been forced to postpone their final  decision on whether to go ahead until the second half of 2010. This  means it is not too late for us to stop this outrageous project. BP  are desperate for Sunrise to go ahead, and will  certainly not go down without a fight, but with effective and sustained  action we can win this one.</p>
<h2>What can I do?</h2>
<p>From Brighton to Scotland,  groups across the UK are already plotting for the Fortnight of Shame.  If your local group isn't already planning something, there&rsquo;s still  loads of times to pull off a fantastic action. If you aren&rsquo;t  part of local group, you could check out the list of  local groups that form the Camp for Climate Action network (<a href="http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/get-involved/local-groups" target="_blank">http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/get-involved/local-groups</a> ) &ndash; or get together with your friends and get cracking!. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Need ideas or resources? Click  here to join an online group set up to share resources and information  that will come in handy for the two weeks of action:<a href="https://we.riseup.net/uktarsandsnetwork" target="_blank">https://we.riseup.net/uktarsandsnetwork</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The BP Fortnight of Shame  is in solidarity with Canadian First Nations communities. When taking action, we need to be aware that actions here can have  unintended but potentially serious repercussions for front-line communities  in Canada. For advice and reflections  on what it means to take action in  solidarity with communities impacted by the tar sands, see our page on protocols. Please take some time to read this page and discuss  what it means for your action..&nbsp;</p>
