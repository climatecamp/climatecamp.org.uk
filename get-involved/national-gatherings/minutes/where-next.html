<p><em>A day of discussion at Climate Camp on Tuesday 1st September 2009</em><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An outline of the camp process including the national gatherings. This day is for a range of things &ndash; navel gazing; self-assessment; where can we go from here.</p>
<p>These minutes are <a href="/get-involved/national-gatherings/Climate_Camp_-_Where_Next.pdf">also available as a PDF</a>.</p>
<h2>History of the Camp</h2>
<p>Climate camp is part of a movement of humanity against the enclosure of space, air, and the planet &ndash; against enclosure by capital.</p>
<p>Various aspects of climate camp:</p>
<h3>Neighbourhoods</h3>
<p>A way of doing things that emerged from the dissent network, in turn from the broad anti-G8 / No Borders movement in France, which was inspired by the Argentinian uprisings in 2001 where decisions were made by 'barrios.'</p>
<h3>Tripods</h3>
<p>Used in Australian tree-defence campaigns in the 80s.</p>
<h3>Consensus decision-making</h3>
<p>From a 1970s feminist text 'the tyranny of structurelessness'. But most decision-making outside government, especially in indigenous groups, has aspects of consensus.</p>
<h3>Affinity groups</h3>
<p>From the anarchist movement in the Spanish civil war which led to the successful liberation of land, and from the 1920s Machno-vite movement in the Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Occupation and land squats</h3>
<p>we have been reclaiming land since time immemorial. More specifically from the peace camps of the 1980s and the German anti-nuclear movement.</p>
<h3>Four themes of climate camp &ndash; direct action, sustainable living, movement building and education.</h3>
<p>Climate camp 1 was outside Drax &ndash; a group of people from the dissent network &ndash; out of Horizone ecovillage in Gleneagles outside the G8 &ndash; pitched in explicit opposition to the 'carbon neutral G8'.</p>
<p>G8 Varg camp in France &ndash; where neighbourhood decision-making began.</p>
<p>The Dissent network &ndash; adopted the PGA (People's Global Action) hallmarks &ndash; principles that identified us including a confrontational attitude and a rejection of lobbying as part of the problem rather than the solution. Also identifying ourselves as specifically anti-capitalist. PGA as a global network reaching from north and south.</p>
<p>Climate Camp broke from previous camps by doing this on <em>our</em> terms, and setting <em>our</em> targets rather than on the terms of or as a reaction to the G8.</p>
<h2>What was the original strategy &amp; objectives of the Camp and why?<strong><br></strong></h2>
<h3>Not homogenous.</h3>
<p>Main three objectives were movement building, creating a space of resistance &amp; capitalising real and symbolic antagonism.</p>
<h3>Why a social movement?</h3>
<p>Overcoming the power of the fossil fuel economy &ndash; all else were working within the paradigm &ndash; oppositional power. something on a scale of other social movements was needed. Top down solutions would make the causes of climate change worse.</p>
<h3>What kind of social movement?</h3>
<p>Grassroots, participatory and self-organised. Challenging consumerism, growth &amp; capitalism. Strong anti-capitalist ethos. Slipping between anti-capitalist / anti-growth &ndash; an ongoing debate. Needed to embrace civil resistance / direct action &ndash; to challenge the 'democratic norms' which don't themselves challenge the system, and because its not about asking others do do things.</p>
<p>But it is difficult to do this because of the atomizing ethos of consumer society which encourages only individual response. We wanted to reject this and come up with a collective solutions. Climate change as a social rather than an environmental issue. The Greens saw climate change as a separate environmental issue, whereas the left saw climate change as something not relevant to them.</p>
<p>Climate change is abstract &ndash; about the weather. We wanted to create symbolic moments of tension to break through this. This was the reason why the first camp was at Drax, Europe's biggest coal-fire station. Saying we'll shut it down was central to this idea.</p>
<p>Hedging our bets politically, we try and have strategic objectives on the way to our Utopian goals &ndash; stopping new coal; aviation expansion etc. We try to strike a balance between broad social objectives and immediate strategic objectives.</p>
<p>All of this(!) was distilled into movement building, education, direct action and sustainable living.</p>
<p>History is important but should be used to interrogate the present. This is our camp now!!</p>
<h2><strong>Achievements<br></strong></h2>
<p>The broad picture. As part of a wider movement.</p>

<li>inspirational 	&ndash; growth of the movement; sparking an ecology of diverse groups .</li>
<li>formation 	of a radical identity through involvement;</li>

<li>Radicalised 	the NGO sector;</li>
<li>concept 	of new coal challenged;</li>
<li>police 	repression on the public agenda.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Critiques of Climate Camp - Exploring the issues<strong><br></strong></h2>
<p>A range of critiques exists &ndash; some are contradictory if opposite extremes; some are personal gripes.</p>
<p>There hasn't been space in previous camps for listening and sharing critiques. If this isn't done, people might leave the process; we might make bad decisions that are contradictory or unhelpful to overall aims. We need to think about about which of the critiques might block the process.</p>
<p>Different types of criticism:</p>
<ul>
<li>block 	&ndash; issue needs addressing or I will leave;</li>
<li>effectiveness 	&ndash; issue needs addressing or won't be effective;</li>
<li>partisan 	&ndash; this doesn't fit into my world so I will criticise;</li>
<li>clarification 	&ndash; misunderstanding/ not listening;</li>
<li>personal 	&ndash; bugbears, or history / relationships;</li>
<li>opinion 	&ndash; not a criticism &ndash; need to make this clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Group discussion and feedback:</p>
<h3>Relationship with the state</h3>
<ul>
<li>Potential at the moment &ndash; unclear 	position &ndash; danger of co-optation as moving towards the mainstream 	&ndash; for the agenda to be taken away from us. Need to push in the 	other direction and create the space for resistance.</li>
<li>Difference between placing demands on 	the state and making an accommodation with the state.</li>
<li>Needs to be addressed &ndash; state is 	inherently linked to the problem.</li>
<li>All short-term gains are state decisions 	so we run the risk of being an aggressive lobby group.</li>
<li>Climate camp should support transitional 	demands e.g. Vestas etc..</li>
<li>This camp isn't threatening anything &ndash; 	is why they're not here.</li>
<li>Are we playing into police hands by not 	having a mass action at camp? If we shift back towards being more 	radical they will be able to use this as an example of their 'good' 	work.</li>
<li>Confusion about engagement with the 	state &ndash; what we are pressing the state for? Using parts of the 	state against the state to strengthen ourselves. Using this years 	camp to train ourselves up for action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directness 	of our actions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not much direct stuff in London. No 	single big-impact target &ndash; reduced to symbolic acts of civil 	disobedience.</li>
<li>Negativity of the actions that have been 	taken &ndash; more positive action needed.</li>
<li>We don't distinguish between direct 	action and publicity stunts. Both are useful, but &hellip;</li>
<li>We focus on accountable, arrest-able 	actions &ndash; but we can't get arrested every day!!</li>
<li>G8 &amp; anti-road &ndash; physical 	interventions were successful &ndash; climate camp isn't following this.</li>
<li>We need to find proportional action to 	the situation we face.</li>
<li>We need to relate to other struggles and 	be part of long term ongoing mass-action.</li>
<li>We need to explore the difference 	between types of action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inclusivity 	of our actions</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Festival feel &ndash; neglect of both 	defence and families.</li>
<li>Neighbourhoods</li>
<li>We spend too much time trying to include 	other people rather than engaging with other struggles.</li>
<li>2 types of inclusivity &ndash; how do you 	get the people in the room to feel included / who should be in the 	room? So, who are we and what are we about?</li>
<li>Unvoiced political differences at 	gatherings.</li>
<li>Camp process is frustrating but it does 	work.</li>
<li>Hard to get involved with ongoing 	process; difficult to get involved if not living somewhere 	permanently.</li>
<li>Too London-centric. Neighbourhoods are 	dis-empowered &ndash; existing outside the main process.</li>
<li>Perception of sense of piety and 	smugness of people associated with the climate camp. People looking 	radical rather than being radically inclusive.</li>
<li>Camp experienced as a festival with 	punters rather than everyone seeing the involvement process &ndash; 	rotas etc..</li>
<li>There is an Illusion that having a 	militant radical message puts people off. We don't need to be scared 	of this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coherence 	of our messaging</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We don't support smaller groups</li>
<li>Using the mainstream media</li>
<li>A lot of thought goes into the message 	that we do have &ndash; we need to admit that we have made decisions and 	stick to them.</li>
<li>We're too quick to pass messaging on to 	the media team.</li>
<li>Climate camp gives us a fake radicalism 	&ndash; we need to move beyond camping and change our name.</li>
<li>There is confusion between stopping 	climate change and breaking down the state and starting again.</li>
<li>How coherent can a message be in a 	network like this? Linking to a critique of the financial system was 	good. The underhand way things have to be done is problematic &ndash; we 	need to create spaces for resolution of issues.</li>
<li>Discomfort with the key message: 	consumption/ growth/ making do with less. We don't come across 	clearly enough to people who have very little now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perpetuation 	of prejudice/ discrimination</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If climate camp sees itself as THE 	agency for change then we have negative interaction with those who 	also have agency;</li>
<li>We're too focused on visible categories 	we discriminate against &ndash; gender etc. rather than age, experience 	etc.. Interventions we do  make are done badly.</li>
<li>Despite peoples best efforts, 	hierarchies are replicated within the camp. e.g. kids space with 	women; media mostly white middle class men &hellip; needs to be a space 	where people can experiment with roles.</li>
<li>More women than men cleaning the loos. 	Discrimination against children.</li>
<li>Different chronotypes are discriminated 	against (those awake different times) - B society in Switzerland</li>
<li>Invisible disabilities &ndash; climate camp 	favours those who are young and fit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our diversity</h3>
<ul>
<li>'We're not dirty gypsies, we're people 	who believe in a sustainable planet' &ndash; quote in the Sunday Times. 	Worries at the fact that some people didn't see anything wrong with 	this.</li>
<li>Report-back from Brixton &ndash; our 	occupation of space was seen as impressive.</li>
<li>Lack of clarity about what it means to 	block decisions &ndash; someone was told she shouldn't be here. 	Shouldn't pressurise people if not vegan/ want to drink.</li>
<li>Issue around trusting people when 	organising open things. Those involved are in a social group; those 	not involved are not in that group.</li>
<li>We leave dealing with difficult people  	to a small group &ndash; throughout the year.</li>
<li>From the outside someone who agrees with 	the camp may be deterred from coming in because they don't look or 	feel different enough.</li>
<li>Lack of working class people and people 	from different races.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The dilution of our radical message</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to learn that the broad church 	approach doesn't work. Within the anti-globalstion movement the 	people fighting for the middle ground were able to get there because 	of the riots.</li>
<li>Culture of skirting around controversies 	&ndash; avoiding disagreement.</li>
<li>Confusion that to be inclusive we have 	to give an inclusive message</li>
<li>Dilution bound up with clarity &ndash; 	making clear what the message is</li>
<li>Internal dilution. Not seen as an 	anti-capitalist movement by all.</li>
<li>Not admitting that some things don't 	work. We need to try more radical stuff.</li>
<li>A radical fringe needs to be open &ndash; 	not all or nothing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Informal hierarchy &ndash; small groups making decisions affecting all</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is one!</li>
<li>We need to step aside and let stuff 	happen.</li>
<li>Because organising is focused on 	national gatherings, heterosexual couples' worlds can fit neatly 	into that structure.</li>
<li>We need to recognise that informal 	hierarchies are always present and address these continually.</li>
<li>Decisions are often made quickly by 	email so participation depends on whether you're online at the time 	or online at all. Part of the problem is how quickly we need to make 	decisions.</li>
<li>Some informal hierarchies are based on 	experience of using the process &ndash; we need to have less experienced 	people there.</li>
<li>Informal hierarchies often come into 	existence to get stuff done. We need to be clear about how we are 	empowered / accountable.</li>
<li>We need to stress the importance of 	teaching others about our role &ndash; more time for skill-sharing</li>
<li>Too much workload? Is this the best way 	to do it? - this is why informal hierarchies are created.</li>
<li>No clarity of decision-making process &ndash; 	how can we make it clear?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unsustainable activism / division of labour</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our current process isn't appropriate 	for where are movement has grown to.</li>
<li>We don't recognise that activism is 	unsustainable &ndash; need to train others up before handing over.</li>
<li>We need to integrate activism into 	everyday lives.</li>
<li>Silver command wants to facilitate 	sustainable activism!!! we want to stop runaway climate change.</li>
<li>Taking personal responsibility for not 	taking on too much. Need fun and rest. Just as important &ndash; get 	beyond the work/ play divide.</li>
<li>We don't have structures set up to 	support ourselves long term.</li>
<li>Group sustainability &ndash; we need to look 	at how we get people in to do this.</li>
<li>There is a macho culture around capacity 	&ndash; stress and massive capacity should not be seen as a good thing</li>
<li>Activism is a mystical division of 	labour &ndash; climate camp as a skill source or tool kit to take to 	others to exchange with them. We can't do the job ourselves.</li>
<li>Hidden process from the beginning &ndash; 	method of secrecy is negative to our movement.</li>
<li>We need to find a way to make sure that 	neighborhoods are working groups.</li>
<li>We need to push jobs out to others 	rather than sucking them up ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Large-scale one off events are draining energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creative people in a non-creative 	process &ndash; not the best place to put peoples minds to.</li>
<li>This comes from a period where we had to 	make our own space as opposed to capitalism. This is changing &ndash; we 	should be responsive to society cracking open.</li>
<li>Camp shouldn't be relaxing and fun for 	one group while others do the work.</li>
<li>Climate camp cares too much about its 	message &ndash; missing what we actually want.</li>
<li>We need to be thinking about multiple 	one-off large scale events.</li>
<li>Have to travel to get here.</li>
<li>We aren't practicing what we preach &ndash; 	not sustainable ourselves.</li>
<li>Too much time talking about how to 	sustain 'us' rather than our politics.</li>
<li>Haven't reflected enough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engagement with workplace &amp; community struggles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other aspects of our activism are seen 	as peripheral rather than integral to our movement. How can we do 	this?</li>
<li>We need to be embedded in the community 	for our movement to grow.</li>
<li>Difficulty in recognising that were 	actually doing these things already but not under climate camp 	banner.</li>
<li>Problem with seeing us as the agency 	rather than as part of a broader constellation of struggles &ndash; need 	to look at workplace struggles and see how they are constructed &ndash; 	ecological approaches spill over.</li>
<li>Best way to answer the criticism on 	diversity.</li>
<li>Need to broaden out to other 	transnational movements including the movement around migrancy.. 	climate camp needs to engage with these movements.</li>
<li>We need to be more responsive in the 	immediate term. Need to be able to respond to local issues as the 	'cracks open up'.</li>
<li>Its hard to teach others about workers 	struggles &ndash; need to skill-share on this as a good way to go 	strategically.</li>
<li>We need to change the jobs we do to 	create the world we want to see.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Group discussion reflecting on the above &ndash; how can we move forward in relation to these criticisms?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The desire to solidify at regional 	level; to have regional rather than national events bearing in mind 	that this is difficult to do &ndash; strategies to negotiate the gaps 	re. Travel / only email contact.</li>
<li>Us going to other groups rather than 	trying to get them to join us.</li>
<li>Continuity with the camp &ndash; more 	permanent land occupations.</li>
<li>Embrace buddying for tasks.</li>
<li>National process isn't helping local 	solutions. National spokes council.</li>
<li>Too much to travel to all meetings. We 	need to regionalise working group tasks. Rotate places doing each 	job.</li>
<li>What we're doing today is the way 	forward &ndash; creating space for discussions.</li>
<li>Bringing the camp to local campaigns 	works well  - working with local communities.</li>
<li>We deal with 'others' differently &ndash; 	challenge our own prejudices.</li>
<li>National gathering once every 2 months; 	neighbourhood gathering every month.</li>
<li>Radically change the way we make 	decisions.</li>
<li>We need to document and skill-share</li>
<li>We need to formalise how we introduce 	people to the movement</li>
<li>Continue workshops throughout the year</li>
<li>We shouldn't over-analyse ourselves</li>
<li>Changing the name!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Break for Lunch</em></p>
<h2>Afternoon structure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Directions and objectives, e.g. Disengage from capitalism</li>
<li>Forms methods and tactics, e.g. Create an alternative economy using chick peas as currency</li>
<li>How will we organise to make this happen? e.g. suspend gatherings and set up permanent camps in each neighbourhood.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where are we now?</h2>
<p>Facilitators recapped the camp's four aims; upcoming forums &ndash; climate swoop; COP15; e.on f.off; Bristol Co-Mutiny.</p>

<li>incorporate 	into existing structures</li>
<li>buddying up</li>
<li>building a network of trainers and 	targets e.g. through crabgrass</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debate</h3>
<ul>
<li>internal and external debate</li>
<li>creating 	time or space (physical or political) for this to take place</li>
<li>many structures exist already &ndash; 	workshops and gatherings</li>
<li>using existing social centres / new 	physical spaces such as  shop in Gillingham / Transition Heathrow 	project</li>
<li>making use of media &ndash; again both 	external and internal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social justice</h3>
<ul>
<li>working with other organisations</li>
<li>challenging current forms of education</li>
<li>looking at kids area in camp &ndash; more of 	a role for education</li>
<li>acknowledging climate camp is about 	education</li>
<li>policy solutions climate camp might 	favour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Connect with other struggles</h3>
<ul>
<li>workers struggles mainly</li>
<li>engage with struggles outside the 	flashpoints &ndash; relationships with unions etc</li>
<li>plan the engagement rather than just 	rushing in</li>
<li>build up lines of communication with 	international groups</li>
</ul>
<h2>Processes to do these things<strong><br></strong></h2>
<h3>To discuss in groups:</h3>
<ul>
<li>decision-making processes</li>
<li>national and neighborhood space</li>
<li>working groups</li>
<li>how we communicate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current process overview:</h3>
<p>We have monthly national gatherings moving around the country to try and include accessibility. Facilitators are arranged by those putting on the gathering; process group tries to make sure it goes smoothly. The camp is made up of different working groups to tackle different elements of the camp. All have remit, budget, email address &amp; need to participate in gatherings.</p>
<p>This year, there's been a South-East bias to national gathering locations. Scotland and Wales have had their own camps and Bristol are about to put on different event. So these neighbourhood have self-decentralised. This time last year at Kingsnorth we said we'd stop it being built. Different projects within the process have been a challenge to manage &ndash; e.on f.off and international etc.. Also, working groups are now also meeting outside national gatherings. The finance process has also been very challenging this year.</p>
<p>International group working towards building for Copenhagen and building links with international camps. Part of the CJA, going to meetings in Copenhagen - participting in the wider network. Its been difficult to get going as we need more people; and difficult to have meetings when we're split around the country, but we have been using skype. Its a complicated process. We are connected into an international process &ndash; meeting of all climate camps is planned at Copenhagen.</p>
<h3>Group discussions &hellip; feedback suggestions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>splitting 	up national process work and working group work</li>
<li>turning 	national gathering into spokes meeting</li>
<li>coordination 	of local and national process</li>
<li>twinning</li>
<li>working 	groups to be allied with neighborhoods</li>
<li>internationalisation 	of the movement</li>
<li>outreach 	through the year</li>
<li>we 	need more time to talk about this! Conference to thrash out ideas. 	Accept that consensus takes a lot more time.</li>
<li>separate 	political &amp; organisational gatherings?</li>
<li>make 	use of the spokes system &ndash; build neighborhood system like that.</li>
<li>keep 	themix of geographical areas in working groups</li>
<li>more skill sharing at neighborhood and 	national gatherings</li>
<li>working groups should make sure people 	are working where needed</li>
<li>all neighbourhoods to be involved in 	working groups</li>
<li>more stuff back than discussed!</li>
<li>Climate camp to be replaced by regional 	autonomous groups. UK national meetings as skillshare / discussions.</li>
<li>use consensus for political rather than 	administrative decisions. Too bureaucratic. Some working groups too 	big?</li>
<li>more time for debate like we had today. 	Have internal discussion and open this out to other groups at an 	urban convergence rather than a camp.</li>
<li>have a strategy day once politics/ aims 	have been sorted out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, where next?!</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Leeds national gathering on 3<sup>rd</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> October, plus working group debriefs.</li>
<li>Proposals about organising our structure 	should go to to the Leeds gathering.</li>
<li>Arrange neighborhood meetings prior to 	the next national gathering.</li>
<li>Suspicion that by November the decision 	about Kingsnorth will be made &ndash; need to take action now!!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where are other ideas going to go?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take proposals to neighborhoods / 	national gatherings / affinity groups as appropriate. Need to 	organise ourselves &ndash; send to <a href="mailto:process@climatecamp.org.uk">process@climatecamp.org.uk</a></li>
<li>We need to start networking now &ndash; swap 	email addresses etc..</li>
<li>Need rapid response process for getting 	engaged &ndash; situations such as workplace struggles, floods etc..</li>
<li>Post-Copenhagen &ndash; 2010 as year for 	international climate action. Host european wide strategy gathering 	then?</li>
<li>Climate camp as completely different 	from the world around us &ndash; need to remember this.</li>
<li>Choose a community and organise in that 	area &ndash; make a party of sorts.</li>
<li>Can just get on and do stuff!!</li>
<li>Talk to friends &ndash; why will/ will not 	people come to climate camps?</li>
<li>Create local community groups on e.g. 	facebook.</li>
<li>Doing stuff online &ndash; googlewave, wiki, 	crabgrass ... need skillshare.</li>
<li>Let's address this 10 year old problem.</li>
<li>Join the international working group.</li>
<li>Logistics of neighborhoods if not in 	same city/ town etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>We are super-amazing!</p>
