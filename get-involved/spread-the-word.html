<p>Make sure you're in good company at the Camp!</p>
<p>Of all the many things to do before the climate camp, perhaps the most important - and certainly the easiest to join in with - is persuading other people to come too!</p>
<p>If you want flyers stickers or posters could you email outreach[at]climatecamp.org.uk or download from <a href="/actions/edinburgh-2010/rbs-flyers-and-stickers">Flyers and Posters</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display some posters</strong>. Veggie cafes or social centers are an obvious place to start, but how about your local community centre, health food shop, or perhaps your workplace. school or college? What about your own front window? Or get fly-posting - maybe go subvertise some dodgy climate-criminals' bill-board adverts?</li>
<li><strong>Distribute leaflets</strong>. Ask if you can leave flyers in your local health food shops, bike shop, cafe. Hand them to your mates. Go and leaflet any demo's taking place locally, or benefit gigs for alternative causes. Go to local festivals or green fairs and see if any of the stall-holders would be willing to have a pile of your leaflets. Or maybe run a stall yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to your friends, family, colleagues</strong> - the more the merrier. Don't assume they aren't interested just because they've never done something like this before. Who knows, maybe they saw it on the news last year and thought it sounded really exciting, but they're still a bit anxious about what it will be like, whether they will get in trouble, whether they will fit in. So, say that you're planning to go and that you'd really like them to join you - once they know there's someone else could be exactly the reassurance they need!</li>
<li><strong>Write letters to the local or national papers</strong>. Look for any stories relating to climate change which could provide a 'hook' for you to write to the letters page about the need for individuals to tackle climate change given the failure of government or business act, and then talk about how you will be going to the climate camp and urge the paper's readers to join you.</li>
<li><strong>Give a talk to your local student group, environmental group or any group you are member of</strong>. Don't be afraid of doing this - the climate camp has a speaker training project to help you prepare, and a template letter to send to any groups you think might be interestsed in hearing about the camp. People are far more likely to come if they hear about the camp from "someone like me" who went last year and really enjoyed it. And ff that was the first time you ever did something like this, don't feel you are too 'inexperienced' to give a great talk about the camp - far from it. You are the perfect person to persuade others that coming to the camp really isn't scary after all, that they won't get in loads of trouble, that they can fit in easily, that it will be one of the most wonderful life-changing things they will ever experience!
