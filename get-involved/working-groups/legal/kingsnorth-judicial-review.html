  <h1>Kingsnorth Judicial Review</h1>
  
    <p><strong>Good news! In January 2010, three Climate Campers - </strong><strong>Dave Morris and </strong><strong>two children known as E&amp;T - were victorious with their judicial review against the Chief Constable of Kent Police</strong>. Their searches under section 1 of PACE at Kingsnorth Climate Camp in 2008 were found to be unlawful, a breach of section 1 PACE and their human rights under articles 8, 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Kent Police finally disclosed the "smoking gun", a briefing document ('Slide 18') to officers that revealed officers were told to search all climate campers because there were reasonable grounds to do so. This was stereotyping and unlawful. <strong><a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2010/01/445509.html">Read more &raquo;</a></strong></p>
<p>A final agreement over damages, a letter of apology  and a letter from the Chief Constable was reached in June 2010. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bindmans.com/index.php?id=750">Full  details here</a> including the full court order and copies of the  letters</p>
<h2>I've submitted a claim. What next?</h2>
<p>Congratulations on getting through the first stage and filing your claim.</p>
<p>We need to know who you are so we can discuss next steps together. So, please could you email <a href="mailto:legal@climatecamp.org.uk">legal@climatecamp.org.uk</a> to let us&nbsp; know you've submitted a claim? Please do this even if you have already emailed us as it makes our admin easier! It would be great if you could send:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- which court you made the claim in<br>&nbsp;- how much you claimed for (if less than the 'up to &pound;4999')<br>&nbsp;- a copy of your 'particulars of claim'<br>&nbsp;- which neighbourhood you were in at the Kingsnorth camp</p>
<p>We'll work out next steps from there, and send out email alerts as we go through the process to this smaller group of people.</p>
<p>Three things for now:</p>
<p><strong>1) LETTER BEFORE CLAIM TO KENT POLICE<br></strong>If you didn't send it, you should still send it asap, saying you've submitted a claim to protect your position etc.</p>
<p><strong>2) DRAFT LETTER TO RESPOND TO KENT POLICE<br></strong>The first thing that will happen after you submit your claim is that you will get a letter from Kent Police with a response date of 7 days. <strong>*Please make sure you respond in this time period*</strong>.<strong> </strong>Please also keep a copy of all incoming and outgoing correspondence on your claim. This is likely to be from Kent Police's solicitors, Berrymans Lace Mawer.</p>
<p>In their letter they enclose the acknowledgement of service they have sent to the court and assert that the personal injury protocol applies and request consent within 7 days for a 3 month stay to allow the Chief Constable to investigate the claim. We are not in a position to give legal advice: we are not practicising solicitors.&nbsp; However, the approach members of the legal team are taking in response in their own claims is in this <a href="/get-involved/working-groups/legal/KINGSNORTH_TEMPLATE_STAY_INVESTIGATION_RESPONSE.doc">draft letter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3) ACCEPTING SETTLEMENTS<br></strong>Please contact Legal before accepting  any offer of settlement. This is vital to ensure that your offer does  not set a precedent for other settlements. It should not, but it's good  to make sure of this.</p>
<h2>Other Questions?</h2>
<p>Contact the Legal Team on legal[at]climatecamp.org.uk or 07946 541511.</p>
