  <h1>How to submit evidence</h1>
  
    <h2>What you can do next...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Email us with a detailed account of what happened. If you don&rsquo;t tell us, we will not know what happened at the Camp. During a Camp you can fill in a form with your account in the Legal Tent. We can give you some advice about what to do next. We may ask if we can use your account for a report we write about the policing of the Climate Camp or if you are willing to talk to the media about your experiences. For more suggestions about sending us a detailed account please see below along with some guidance about how to send us video footage.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/index/complaints/forms/form_complaint.htm">Complain to the IPCC</a> (but if you were seriously injured or saw someone seriously injured please contact us first). We can&rsquo;t complain for you but we do like to monitor complaints and their outcome.</li>
    <li>Write to your MP</li>
    <li>Read the legal updates in the Climate Camp newsletter &ndash; look out for calls for witnesses and other requests for help.</li>
    <li>If you are arrested, please keep us informed about what happens.</li>
    <li>Some people may have legal claims having been injured or wrongfully arrested by the police.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sending us detailed accounts</h2>
<p>Email us your detailed accounts. Remember that the person reading your statement will not have been there and so you have to set the scene for them. Please cover what happened, where it happened, when it happened and who was involved. Please give the context: what was happening just before and after the incident. You may wish to include how you felt. Examples of personal accounts we received after the G20 are in our legal report (go to our home page for the link).</p>
<p>Please include a meaning subject heading for the email (i.e. Account &ndash; DATE, TIME, LOCATION, TYPE OF INCIDENT).</p>
<p>Your account <em>must include as a minimum a reliable way of contacting you</em>, ideally by phone as we may need to contact you urgently.</p>
<p>If at all possible include details for other people you refer to in your account. It is helpful if you include basic information about yourself like the town you live in, your age, and your occupation.</p>
<h2>Sending us video footage</h2>
<p>Do NOT edit your video in any way, we must have raw footage. Be sure to include a bit of footage before &amp; after the incident to set the scene.</p>
<p>We often don't have time to watch all the way through all the films at first (they come in all at once) to see what they contain. So please make sure it is really well labeled with location, and time, and details of the incident, and when in the film the incident occurs so we can go straight to the important bit later.</p>
<p>We need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Straight after the event, to quickly see a low-res version, via YouTube</li>
    <li>Plus a bigger, high quality copy to store, edit &amp; use, via Mongofiles</li>
    <li>Your permission to use it - as we see fit for legal and/or media team projects</li>
    <li>Reliable contact details, we might need to get hold of you urgently</li>
    <li>Any personal account that goes with it</li>
</ul>
<h3>To let us quickly inspect film via YouTube</h3>
<p>YouTube is great for quickly checking out things (although not good enough quality for legal/TV use). So, upload video to YouTube, with careful annotations saying what it shows when in the video, why this is important, and set it to private viewing only, so no-one else can watch it yet. Then invite the YouTube account &quot;uklegalobserver&quot; to be your friend. Once we're 'friends' you have to share that private video with us:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In 'My Videos', click 'Uploaded Videos'.</li>
    <li>Click 'Edit Video Info' button for that video.</li>
    <li>Under the 'Broadcast Options', check the box for 'uklegalobserver'</li>
    <li>Click the 'Update Video Info' button to finish.</li>
    <li>Send uklegalobserver@hotmail.com an email, saying what is in your video and who/what it relates to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your footage shows different incidents, consider uploading different clips for each, but it is most important to keep things in context. Then email us your detailed account together with a link to the video(s). If you think your footage could be unhelpful to any protestors, please do not upload it, and get in touch with us instead to discuss. (We will review it first some other way.) Finally, bear in mind that to USE your film, we'll need a higher quality version than YouTube provides - see below.</p>
<h3>To send us high quality files</h3>
<p>We need high quality footage (as above) which is too big to email. So get yourself a free Mongofiles or 'YouSendIt' account: (www.mongofiles.com or www.yousendit.com) , upload your file, then send us a link to it.</p>
<h3>Recommended video settings if you are saving/converting files</h3>
<p>There's a balance between quality and size. Quality is more important- within reason. Ideally, suppose you have Quicktime - do &quot;export movie to MP4&quot; and choose Options: H.264 codec, Data rate - 8192 Kbps. Leave image size and frame rate as 'original' or 'automatic'. This should be good enough for TV footage if<br />
needed, without being so big we can't handle it.</p>
<p>If the above means nothing to you, don't panic. Send us the original file.</p>
<p>If you have footage but can&rsquo;t make this work: email us with your phone number and we will get someone to call you and talk you through it.</p>
