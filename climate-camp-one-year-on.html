  <h1>Climate Camp one year on</h1>
  
    <p><span><span><strong>Climate Camp: One year on, what should happen to the resources?</strong><br> <br> <br> In February 2011 a group came together for a week, in the beautiful setting of Dorset, at '<a href="http://climatecamp.org.uk/Minutes_of_Space_for_Change.pdf">Space for Change</a>' where we wanted to decide where next for Climate Camp. The following decision was reached:<br> <br> "We will not organise as the national Camp for Climate Action in 2011. This means not organising national gatherings as Climate Camp. This is intended to allow space for new structures, process and tactics to emerge. This decision is not intended to direct local groups who organise using the Climate Camp name, who have always been autonomous."<br> <br> Then 'interim working groups' were set up to explore these 'new structures, processes and tactics' which became a series of meetings titled Common Ground, New Directions and the inventively named New Directions Part 2. Out of this process, a new group emerged called the Climate Justice Collective: <a href="http://climatejusticecollective.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://climatejusticecollective.wordpress.com/</a><br> <br> In the meantime, there has been a <a href="http://brightonclimateaction.org.uk/">Climate Camp in Lewes</a>; <a href="http://frack-off.org.uk/">Frack-off</a> has become a national network taking action against Fracking: shale gas extraction; and people involved in the climate justice movement have been busy organising around the country with <a href="http://www.occupyuk.info/">Occupy</a>, <a href="http://ukuncut.org.uk/">UK Uncut</a>, student groups, <a href="http://greenandblackcross.org/">Green and Black Cross</a> and in many other ways in the struggle for economic, social and environmental justice. <br> <br> <span><span>We now face a new year, and so it's time to decide what the next step is</span></span>: What should happen to Climate Camp's resources: its money, equipment, the online resources as well as the skills and knowledge built up by the network that has achieved so much in its 5 years fighting the root causes of climate change?<br> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br> We will need a meeting and a process to make these decisions.<br> If you would like to be involved in organising this meeting please email <a href="mailto:spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk" target="_blank">spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk</a></span></span></p>
<p>What resources there are also need to be audited, if you can help with this please email spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk</p>
<p><span><span><span>Please email your thoughts to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk" target="_blank">spaceforchange@climatecamp.org.uk</a></span></span></span></p>
